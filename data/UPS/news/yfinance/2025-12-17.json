    "summary": "The U.S. Postal Service said Wednesday it intends to open its “last-mile” delivery network, the most expensive part of the shipping process, to large and small shippers, expanding beyond current arrangements with giants such as Amazon and UPS.  The postal service expects to accept bids in late January or early February from other shippers, which will propose their own mix of volume, price and delivery timing.  The agency will award contracts later in 2026, based on where it can provide same- and next-day delivery service at a profit.",
