    "summary": "Shares of FedEx (NYSE: FDX) hit a new 52-week low on March 21 after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and trimmed its full-year guidance again.  Shares of rival package delivery company United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) also fell on the news, and then sold off by another 5.1% on March 25 in apparent response to Bank of America analyst Ken Hoexter's downward revision of his forecast for the logistics giant.  With the stock at its lowest level since July 2020, is UPS a buy, or is the dividend stock falling for valid reasons?",
