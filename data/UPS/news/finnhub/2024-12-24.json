    "summary": "It has been a rough year for the transportation sector. Could 2025 signal a brighter road ahead? BofA Securities transportation analyst Ken Hoexter speaks with Yahoo Finance Anchors Brad Smith and Josh Lipton to discuss trends for the sector — highlighting the end of a two-and-a-half-year freight recession. “You know, we're starting to build out of it,” Hoexter says. “We're seeing enough independent, small mom-and-pop truckload bankruptcies that have cleared up a lot of the excess capacity that's been around since the Covid loans, that that has kept too much capacity, but really comes all down to demand.\" When asked about FedEx's (FDX) decision to spin off its freight business, Hoexter calls it a \"huge value unlock\" for the company.
