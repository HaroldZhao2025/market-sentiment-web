    "summary": "The U.S. Postal Service said Wednesday it intends to open its “last-mile” delivery network, the most expensive part of the shipping process, to large and small shippers, expanding beyond current arrangements with giants such as Amazon and UPS.  The postal service expects to accept bids in late January or early February from other shippers, which will propose their own mix of volume, price and delivery timing.  The agency will award contracts later in 2026, based on where it can provide same- and next-day delivery service at a profit.",

The postal service move reverses a policy, put in place in 2024 by then-Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, that restricted access to facilities that handled last-mile deliveries.  The idea was to get shippers to funnel more packages into the postal network earlier in the delivery process.",
