    "summary": "Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and President-elect Donald Trump's upcoming second term in the White House, Gabelli Funds portfolio manager and aerospace and defense analyst Tony Bancroft joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how to play the defense sector. \"Overall, the US and the new administration probably still wants to retain its stature as the world's superpower,\" Bancroft says, adding, \"I know that there's been a lot of discussion with the DOGE and cutting costs [and] federal spending. But I think the industry is a relatively an oligopoly,\" Bancroft says. \"There's going to be definitely a friction [between the federal government and defense contractors] and there's going to be negotiations on both sides. But I think the defense industry will probably do well in the long run,\" he adds. Bancroft names Boeing (BA) as one of the top holdings of Gabelli's Aerospace and Defense ETF (GCAD) and says the fund likes Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and RTX Corp (RTX), formerly known as formerly Raytheon Technologies Corporation.
