    "summary": "The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) is offering an attractive dividend yield today of around 4% or so.  For all the stocks that remain, it creates a composite score looking at cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and a company's five-year dividend growth rate.  It is likely buying many of the same companies that a dividend investor would be looking at if they invested in individual stocks.",
