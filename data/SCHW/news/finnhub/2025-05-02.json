There are many days to celebrate various things nowadays, from the invention of the hot dog to pets. You can add one more to the list that is near and dear to the Yahoo Finance team: National Investing Day. Charles Schwab (SCHW) coined the term for May 1, which coincides with the 50th anniversary of the SEC eliminating fixed commission rates. This event marked a significant catalyst for the investing industry as it democratized trading for retail investors. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi welcomes Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster to the Opening Bid mic. Wurster assumed the role of CEO in January of this year after several years of advancement within the brokerage. Like his predecessor, Wurster has developed a close relationship with investing pioneer Chuck Schwab. Wurster shares why it’s important for more people to become informed about investing and what he has learned from Schwab. He also shares his latest insights on the broader stock market following a volatile April that initially undermined investor confidence but then left them hopeful as the Trump administration slightly eased tariff rhetoric. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid is produced by Langston Sessoms",
