The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the probe, said an anonymous letter sent last week to the WEF's board raised concerns about its governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the forum's resources without proper oversight.  The WEF \"takes these allegations seriously, it emphasizes that they remain unproven, and will await the outcome of the investigation to comment further,\" the forum said in an emailed statement to Reuters.",
