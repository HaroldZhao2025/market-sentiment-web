    "summary": "Charles Schwab’s  asset-management unit said Monday it will cut fees on four index exchange-traded funds and it announced another method to lower costs for investors—it is splitting shares (comparable to a stock split, so the funds will cost less per share) on six Schwab mutual funds.  The moves may help Schwab attract more customer dollars as the cost-savings on ETFs will help it compete with other low-cost funds and the share split will make shares more affordable.  The fee reductions, which will be effective June 10, are between 0.02 and 0.04 percentage points (or two and four basis points) for each fund.",
