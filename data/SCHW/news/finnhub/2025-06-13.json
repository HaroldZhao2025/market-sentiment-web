The fee cuts are modest—between two and four basis points—but Schwab says they will bring the cost of all its equity and fixed-income market cap-weighted index ETFs to less than 10 basis points.  The cuts continue a trend of fee reductions in the industry, and follow similar recent moves by Vanguard and E*Trade.",
