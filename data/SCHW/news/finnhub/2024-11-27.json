    "summary": "In a rare move for a wealth management operation,  UBS  amended its compensation plan for next year, trimming payouts for lower-producing financial advisors.  The move risks advisor departures in the short term but could help the Swiss bank improve the profitability of its U.S. wealth management unit.  Advisors who manage relatively smaller sums of money will likely be hardest hit.",
