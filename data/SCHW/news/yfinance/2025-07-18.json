Decliners on the stock market today included American Express while Google-parent Alphabet managed some gains.  The blue-chip index had stumbled by more than 200 points earlier after the Financial Times reported that Trump wants a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on EU goods brought into U.S. The report, citing unnamed sources, said a 10% tariff on most items had been part of discussions regarding a framework trade agreement.",
