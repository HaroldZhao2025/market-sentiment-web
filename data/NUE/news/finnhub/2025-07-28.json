    "summary": "Nucor on Monday posted a fall in second-quarter profit, as rising raw material costs pressured the company's steelmaking segment, sending its shares down 3.8% after the bell. While U.S. steelmakers benefited from President Trump's tariffs on steel imports — which pushed spot prices higher — the quarter also saw increased raw material costs. The company said it expects third-quarter earnings to be slightly lower than in the second quarter of 2025, citing decreased earnings in the steel mills segment and similar results in the steel products and raw materials segments.",
