    "summary": "Investors are pretty much convinced that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later today, but they’ve been increasingly expecting a “hawkish cut.”  Interest-rate futures showed early Wednesday that traders see a less than 29% chance that the Fed cuts rates at least three times in 2026, according to CME Group, down from 56% shortly before Thanksgiving.  Last month, signs that the Fed would cut rates at its upcoming meeting initially caused traders to also start expecting more cuts next year.",
