    "summary": "Surging Chinese investment demand has pulled the metal higher, with premiums for spot silver in Shanghai rising above $8 an ounce over London prices, the biggest spread on record.  The blistering rally has provoked extreme measures in China’s investment landscape, with the country’s only pure-play silver fund turning away new customers after its repeated risk warnings went unheeded.  The fund’s premium ballooned last week to more than 60% over the value of its underlying assets — silver contracts on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.",
