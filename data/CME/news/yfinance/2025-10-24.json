    "summary": "Friday’s cooler-than-expected inflation data has done little to change investors’ interest-rate expectations.  Interest-rate futures showed Friday afternoon that investors see a roughly 50% chance that the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate will fall below 3% by the end of next September from its current target range of 4%-4.25%, according to CME Group data.  Investors were already betting that the Fed would cut rates in the coming months due to concerns about a weakening labor market, making inflation data less of a focus.",
