    "summary": "Precious metals have risen dramatically this year on heightened geopolitical tensions and worries about the independence of the Federal Reserve, which have supported the debasement trade.  Gold’s recent surge “reflects a rare alignment of forces rather than a single catalyst,” said Christopher Hamilton, head of client solutions for Asia-Pacific ex-Japan at asset manager Invesco Ltd. “The speed with which gold is breaking milestones underscores how quickly confidence in traditional policy tools is eroding.”  Spot gold has risen by nearly 30% this year and silver by around two-thirds, in a rapid acceleration of multiyear bull runs.",
