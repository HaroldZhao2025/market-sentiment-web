    "summary": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump may see lower Federal Reserve interest rates as a fix for two politically potent problems, the cost of servicing $36 trillion in government debt and the high cost of home ownership, but the path there may touch a third rail elected officials typically try to avoid - rising unemployment.  It is a dilemma tied to the fact that, so far, the rising import taxes and immigration crackdown imposed by Trump have been absorbed by the U.S. and global economies with less disruption than initially feared.  The situation, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference on Wednesday, has left the central bank no compelling reason to lower interest rates until something changes.",
