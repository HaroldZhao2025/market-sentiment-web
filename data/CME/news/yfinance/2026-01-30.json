    "summary": "The world’s biggest metals bourse opened belatedly at 10:00 a.m Hong Kong time on Friday after standard pre-trading checks identified a potential technical issue, and the exchange ordered a precautionary delay.  After the delayed start, benchmark three-month futures fell by almost 4% to near $13,000 a ton on the LME, after peaking above $14,500 on Thursday following a sudden wave of buying by Chinese speculative investors with few precedents.  Copper has been at the heart of a remarkable period of trading, fueled by optimism over demand from the energy transition, as well as a steadily weaker US dollar, which hit a four-year low earlier this week.",
