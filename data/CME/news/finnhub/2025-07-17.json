The euro rose against the dollar after the U.S. rolled out larger-than-expected tariffs in April, knocking the buck to a three-year low and raising concerns about U.S. assets, its exceptionalism and economic growth.  That rationale is being challenged with U.S. stocks staging a 26% recovery from their April lows to rise 6.4% for the year, aided by postponements to the implementation of import tariffs, better-than-feared first-quarter earnings and positive economic data.",
