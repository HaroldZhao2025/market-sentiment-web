    "summary": "Pipeline operator Williams said it has asked federal energy regulators to reinstate permissions necessary to build two natural-gas supply lines into New York and has also begun the processes of appeasing state environmental regulators in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.  The resurrection of two left-for-dead pipeline projects comes after talks between President Trump and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul that convinced energy executives that pipelines carrying Appalachian shale gas into the Northeast would not see the same resistance that plagued the projects during previous administrations.",
