    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Japan's top power generator JERA is in advanced talks to buy natural gas production assets in the U.S. for around $1.7 billion, people familiar with the matter said, the latest example of the Asian nation investing in America's energy sector.  JERA emerged as the top bidder for the assets owned by GEP Haynesville II, a joint venture between Blackstone-backed GeoSouthern Energy and pipeline operator Williams Companies, after banks solicited offers in recent weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.  The deal would mark JERA's first foray in shale gas production, and give one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers more control of its supply chain as Japan prepares for a surge in power demand from data centers critical to the artificial intelligence boom.",
