    "summary": "Woodside Energy has held talks with several potential buyers of stakes in its Louisiana liquefied natural gas plant, including Tokyo Gas, Japan's JERA and Saudi Aramco-backed MidOcean Energy, multiple sources told Reuters.  The timing of the stake sale is a test case for buoyant market expectations around LNG with the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency.  Trump has said trade partners should buy more U.S. energy and issued several executive orders in his first weeks in office aimed at boosting domestic oil and gas output.",
