    "summary": "Shares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) were pulling back in December due to a backlash against the company following the murder of one of its executives and reports of a potential crackdown on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), including UnitedHealth's OptumRx.  Other media reports also shone a harsh light on the business and could lead to more regulation or an overhaul of some healthcare industry practices.  UnitedHealth stocks initially rose after Brian Thompson, the CEO of its insurance division, was murdered on Dec. 4, but it then fell sharply over the next two sessions as thousands of people on social media took the opportunity to vent their frustrations about the healthcare system and UnitedHealthcare's practices in particular.",
