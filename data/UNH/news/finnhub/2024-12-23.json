    "summary": "Health insurance claim denials continue to be a significant challenge in the US healthcare system. When insurers reject claims, doctors and hospitals face delays in reimbursement for their services, often leading them to postpone patient care until procedures or treatments receive proper authorization. Recent Medicare data reveals that the industry average for denied claims has reached 17%, with UnitedHealthcare (UNH) showing the highest denial rate at 33%. Yahoo Finance Senior Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani examines this issue, highlighting automation and artificial intelligence as one of the driving forces behind high denial rates. She discusses implications for healthcare providers and patients, and shares three tips to fight claim denials: 1) never pay the first bill, 2) fight with insurer for coverage, and 3) ask for cash pay options.  To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.
