The suspect of last week's fatal shooting, Luigi Mangione, has been charged with Thompson's murder after being arrested in Altoona, PA on Monday. As more information comes out, NYPD investigators have already deemed the assassination to be a \"pre-meditated [and] pre-planned, targeted attack.\" Anomaly CEO Mike Desjadon sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills to have a conversation about the complexities and greatest challenges Americans face in navigating the healthcare system.  \"So often in healthcare... behind the scenes, there's this whole industry figuring out what to bill and whom to bill. That part of healthcare costs a half a trillion dollars a year, and it's done wrong more than 20% of the time,\" Desjadon explains. \"So to you, you might not get a bill, you might get a bill.
