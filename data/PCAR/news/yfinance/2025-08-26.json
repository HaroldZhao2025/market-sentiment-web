    "summary": "(Reuters) -The Trump administration's tariffs have raised manufacturing costs for the $50 billion U.S. heavy-duty truck industry, prompting companies to consider sourcing more components from Mexico to benefit from concessions under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).  U.S. truck manufacturers currently face 50% tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and copper derivatives under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.  In addition, manufacturers like Bellevue, Washington-based Paccar are hit with tariffs on every non-USMCA-compliant part they import.",
