    "summary": "(Reuters) -Bio-Techne on Wednesday said it expects uncertainty related to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff and academic funding policies to spill into its fiscal year 2026 and could create pressure on the company's performance.  \"We expect low single-digit growth until there is more certainty around various administration policies out there on academic funding, pharmaceutical tariffs and MFN (most favored nation) pricing,\" Chief Financial Officer Jim Hippel said on an investor call.  Significant cuts to U.S. academic research, along with potential tariffs for the pharmaceutical sector and the proposed MFN drug pricing model, have introduced a sense of uncertainty across the company's healthcare clients.",
