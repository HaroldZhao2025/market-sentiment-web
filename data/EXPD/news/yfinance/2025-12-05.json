    "summary": "The Dow Jones Transportation Average has gained for nine consecutive days, a winning streak seen just five other times this century.  Truckers, shippers, airline and railroad companies carry goods and services that stock the US economy, and a breakout in their share prices soothes nerves of investors worried that growth will eventually sour.  “If the Dow Jones Industrial Average is climbing, that’s fine, but if the Dow Jones Transportation Average confirms the move, that means something deeper: companies aren’t just producing, they are delivering,” wrote Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial.",
