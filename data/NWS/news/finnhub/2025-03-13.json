In a Wednesday night complaint filed in San Francisco federal court, Brave said News Corp sent a cease-and-desist letter threatening litigation and demanding compensation for the alleged misappropriation of copyrighted articles by \"scraping\" its websites and indexing their content.  Brave countered that it is \"fair use\" to index website content, \"which all search engine operators must do to exist.\"",
