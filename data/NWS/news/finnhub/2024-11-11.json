    "summary": "In honor of Veterans Day, Realtor.com® released new research today, which found that over the last year, more than 3 in 4 (74.5%) home sales with Veterans Affairs (VA) loans had a 0% down payment and nearly 8 in 10 (83.5% of) VA home loan sales had a down payment below 10%. Down payments are a major barrier to homeownership and this new research found a VA borrower is more than twice as likely as a conforming borrower to have made a low down payment, easing the up-front costs of homeownership.",
