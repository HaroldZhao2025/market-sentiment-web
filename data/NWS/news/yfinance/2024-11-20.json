    "summary": "News Corp said on Wednesday that investors rejected a proposal by activist investor Starboard Value to break the Murdoch family's grip on the publisher by ending a dual class voting structure.  The company said the hedge fund's non-binding shareholder resolution fell short of securing the number of votes needed to pass at today's annual meeting.  The Murdoch family controls more than 40% of the voting shares, making it a tough battle for the hedge fund to win from the start.",
