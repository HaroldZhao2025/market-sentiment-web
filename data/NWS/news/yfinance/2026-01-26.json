    "summary": "Luxury home prices stabilized at the end of 2025, while the gap between luxury homes and typical listings varied widely across local housing markets. The national entry point for luxury, defined as the 90th percentile of listing prices, was $1.19 million in December, down just 0.6% from a year ago, according to the December Realtor.com® Luxury Housing Report. The smaller decline compared with earlier months suggests luxury prices overall may be approaching a near-term floor.",
