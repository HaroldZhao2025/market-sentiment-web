    "summary": "For many Americans, the creaks and whispers in the night might not just be old plumbing or a mischievous pet. According to a new survey from Realtor.com®, a combined 86% of Americans believe it's possible that houses can be haunted. In fact, 12% say they've lived in a haunted home themselves, and another 7% know someone who has. Only 14% of respondents say they don't believe in hauntings at all—proof that the supernatural still has a strong hold on the nation's imagination.",
