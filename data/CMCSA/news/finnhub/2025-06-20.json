Predicting what’s coming up is easier said than done, even for top executives. But that doesn’t stop folks from trying! Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast from the Spotify Beach house at the annual Cannes Lions advertising and media conference with Candle Media CEO Kevin Mayer. Mayer spent 25 years as a top Disney executive and was seen as a potential successor to CEO Bob Iger. Mayer weighs in on the future of Disney (DIS), who may succeed Iger, and why Disney may not sell its TV business. Mayer also shared his thoughts on the crumbling legacy TV industry, which has seen streamers like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) trigger breakups at Comcast (CMCSA) and Warner Bros. (WBD). Candle Media is also behind the children’s program Cocomelon — Mayer discusses what’s next for the popular brand.
