Warner on Wednesday had told its shareholders in a public letter that Paramount’s latest offer for the entire company wasn’t superior, “or even comparable,” to its $72 billion deal with Netflix.  Netflix agreed in December to pay $27.75 a share in stock-and-cash for Warner’s movie and TV studios and the HBO Max streaming service following Warner’s planned separation of its cable networks later this year.",
