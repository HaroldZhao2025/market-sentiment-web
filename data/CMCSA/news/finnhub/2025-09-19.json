    "summary": "Comcast is planning to cut jobs at its biggest unit that houses its Xfinity internet, mobile and pay television business, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday, as the company attempts to centralize operations and bolster its broadband business.  Starting January, Comcast will remove a layer between the corporate and regional offices, a shake-up that will streamline the management of the unit but also reduce headcount.  The connectivity and platforms unit, which also operates the Sky brand across Europe, currently has a three-tier management structure where the regional teams report to division heads, who then serve as the link to corporate headquarters.",
