    "summary": "(Reuters) -Netflix shares declined more than 5% in early trading on Friday, as investors were disappointed by the streaming giant's revenue forecast raise being driven by a weaker dollar instead of strong customer demand.  The stock has nearly doubled in value in the last 12 months, pushing Netflix's market value above $540 billion, more than the combined worth of Disney, Comcast, and Warner Bros. Discovery.  The streaming platform on Thursday raised its 2025 revenue outlook and expects to be in the range of $44.8 billion to $45.2 billion, broadly helped by a weaker dollar, compared to its previous forecast range of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion.",
