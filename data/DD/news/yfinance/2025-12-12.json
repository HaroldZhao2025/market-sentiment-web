    "summary": "The US luxury and exotic car market is projected to grow from $110 billion today to between $180 and $215 billion by 2035. The strongest growth is expected in vehicles priced between $100,000 and $170,000—both new and used—with annual sales forecast to rise 6% to 8%. In contrast, slower growth is expected in the higher-margin \"ultra-luxury\" and \"hyper-luxury\" segments (vehicles priced at $170,000 and above).",
