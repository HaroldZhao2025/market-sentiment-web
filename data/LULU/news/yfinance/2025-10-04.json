    "summary": "When it comes to the notoriously competitive retail sector, every dollar counts.  Return on invested capital, or ROIC, is a measure of how much operating profit a company can wring out of every dollar it invests in its business—whether equity from shareholders or debt from lenders.  It’s particularly important in evaluating the retail sector, which is known for stiff competition, low margins, and big upfront investment in inventory, storefronts, and more.",
