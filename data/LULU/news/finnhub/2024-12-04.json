    "summary": "Lululemon, facing its slowest quarterly growth in more than four years, will have to deal with Wall Street questions on whether it has made significant strides toward fast-tracking trendier styles to its stores to better compete with athleisure upstarts.  Lululemon is likely to see revenue rise nearly 7% to $2.36 billion in the third quarter ended October, according to estimates compiled by LSEG, compared with a nearly 19% jump in the same period a year ago.  The Canada-based maker of high-end yoga pants, joggers and sweatshirts, has been losing ground to brands such as Alo Yoga and Vuori, which refresh their shelves with fresh styles more frequently, a practice that appeals to younger shoppers.",
