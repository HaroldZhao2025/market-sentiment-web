    "summary": "Shares of Lululemon Athletica (LULU) are soaring in Friday’s session on the back of strong third quarter results. The athletic apparel company raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald spoke with Yahoo Finance host Julie Hyman about the athleisure brand's performance. Lululemon’s growth in China was a particular bright spot, where comparable sales grew 27% during the quarter; that’s compared to a 2% decline in the Americas market. McDonald believes Lululemon’s community-focused model has played a significant role in that success, noting that its strong foundation “allows us to continue to grow and withstand some macro challenges.” While acknowledging that growth in the US and the Americas has been slower, McDonald remains optimistic about the brand’s prospects, especially in the women’s category. \"There’s no doubt in my mind that we have a long runway of growth still in the Americas,\" he says, attributing that the slowing US growth to “missed opportunities in newness.” Which has been a big focus going forward as McDonald says \"there’s a lot of really exciting newness” coming in the new year.

    "headline": "Lululemon's investment into China stores is 'paying off': Analyst",
    "summary": "Lululemon stock is in focus after the company reported an earnings beat, driven by its stores outside of the US. Morningstar senior equity analyst David Swartz joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the results. Swartz says, \"The international sales growth was quite strong. Lululemon sales in the US and North America have slowed down. That's clear. But, the company still has a lot of potential for growth, both in China and Europe, and possibly other parts of Asia too. Right now, Lululemon is opening most of its stores in China, and that investment really seems to be paying off.\" The analyst adds, \"These results suggest that Lululemon has overcome some of those problems. I think some of the merchandising issues still remain. The company has done some reorganization of its product development team, and it's going to be some time before some of these new designs and new products get into the stores.

Morningstar senior equity analyst David Swartz joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the results. Swartz says, \"The international sales growth was quite strong. Lululemon sales in the US and North America have slowed down. That's clear. But, the company still has a lot of potential for growth, both in China and Europe, and possibly other parts of Asia too. Right now, Lululemon is opening most of its stores in China, and that investment really seems to be paying off.\" The analyst adds, \"These results suggest that Lululemon has overcome some of those problems. I think some of the merchandising issues still remain. The company has done some reorganization of its product development team, and it's going to be some time before some of these new designs and new products get into the stores.
