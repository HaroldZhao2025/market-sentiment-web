      "summary": "Lululemon joins a list of retailers rattled by uncertainty around U.S. President Donald Trump's erratic tariff decisions, which have shaken consumer confidence that was already weak with Americans being careful about shelling out more dollars on everything from groceries to nice-to-have items amid still-high inflation.  According to Piper Sandler analysts, the debate continues to be whether the real issue is brand maturity and saturation in a competitive market for Lululemon.  Some analysts said there is a growing consumer enthusiasm for Lululemon's Glow Up tank tops and Daydrift high-rise trousers, but an uncertain environment dims hopes of a rebound in demand soon.",
