On Trading Pit, Stocks in Translation host Jared Blikre and Trader Talk host Kenny Polcari break down how pros really manage risk, from matching your timeframe and goals to using the S&P 500 (^GSPC) as a core benchmark. They walk through sector rotations in healthcare and utilities, show why charts flagged Lululemon (LULU) and Palantir (PLTR) as “priced for perfection,” and explain the volatility trade-off in names like IonQ (IONQ) versus broader tech ETFs. You’ll learn how to avoid accidental overexposure to giants like Apple (AAPL), use basic technicals and P/E ratios, and keep emotions in check as you build a portfolio that can survive the next round of market turbulence.
