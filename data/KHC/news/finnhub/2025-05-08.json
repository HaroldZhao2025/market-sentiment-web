    "summary": "Food maker Kraft Heinz, which sells top U.S. coffee brand Maxwell House, has asked its coffee suppliers for 60 days' notice before hiking prices due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to a document seen by Reuters.  In the document sent in April, the company asked suppliers to raise prices only if the tariffs are permanent and to immediately reverse them if the levies are removed, underscoring the struggle U.S. companies face to contain the fallout from Trump's erratic and punitive trade policies.  The document also dashes the hopes of investors in U.S.-based companies and Trump administration officials that companies with big buying power like Kraft Heinz could negotiate better deals from their suppliers to help offset tariffs.",
