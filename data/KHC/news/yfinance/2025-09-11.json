    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Kraft Heinz's announcement this month that it would split was a belated acknowledgment that the Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup maker had missed consumers' years-long shift away from processed foods, a trend that is now accelerating under a new push from the federal government and states including California.  The rise of the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement led by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who blames artificial ingredients for chronic childhood diseases like diabetes and obesity, poses a new threat for the company that makes products including Oscar Mayer hotdogs, Kraft Singles and Jell-O desserts.  Former employees said Kraft Heinz executives missed opportunities to appeal to the new demand for fewer preservatives and artificial ingredients, such as ketchup without high-fructose corn syrup and they were also unconvinced the costly and possibly risky effort to change an iconic brand would boost sales.",
