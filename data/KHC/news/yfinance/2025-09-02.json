Freixe is replaced by Nespresso chief Philipp Navratil, 49, a rising star at the world's largest food company, as it struggles to deal with the impact of U.S. tariffs, a darkening global economic outlook and dwindling investor confidence after years of underperformance.  Laying bare wider tensions, Tuesday was a whipsaw day for global consumer companies as Japan's Suntory parted with its CEO and Kraft Heinz announced a split and activist investor Elliott Management called for a turnaround at PepsiCo.",
