    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Some investors in PepsiCo support suggestions by activist shareholder Elliott Investment Management that the global food and beverage company cut costs and ditch sleepy brands like Quaker, but sound more cautious about the hedge fund's boldest idea - to hive off the soda maker's bottling network.  Elliott has said the move, which mirrors actions taken by Coca-Cola nearly a decade ago, would increase PepsiCo's margins, allow the $200 billion company to focus on new chips and sodas and turn it into a simpler, more-focused organization.  Earlier this month, Elliott unveiled a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo - one of its largest investments- and released a 75-page report with ideas on how to boost profit at the company, whose share price has tumbled nearly 20% in the last year, underperforming a 2% fall in the broader S&P consumer staples index.",
