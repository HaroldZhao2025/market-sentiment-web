    "summary": "The New York-based company’s Tetra Paks—four-sided paperboard cartons emblazoned with palm trees—lead the coconut water pack, dominating the U.S. market with a 44% market share.  Vita Coco stock, at $43.14, has nearly tripled since it went public in October 2021, in contrast to Coca-Cola’s modest ascent of 30% over the period.  Consumer tastes have changed dramatically since Coke’s heyday, and Vita Coco has responded with a product mix that should quench investors’ thirst for growth and reasonable value.",
