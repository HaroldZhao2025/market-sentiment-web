    "summary": "(Reuters) -U.S. soft drinks giant Keurig Dr Pepper is set to create a global coffee giant to rival market leader Nestle with an $18 billion takeover of JDE Peet's, Europe's largest acquisition in more than two years.  The deal, announced on Monday and offering a 20% premium to JDE Peet's closing market price on Friday, proposes splitting the merged entity's coffee operations and other beverage businesses into two separate publicly U.S.-listed companies, as the Dutch company would be delisted from the Amsterdam stock exchange.  \"The new Coffee entity will be somewhat similar in size to the coffee business of Nestle... The two would each have a market share of around 20% in the global CPG (consumer packaged goods) coffee market\" ING analyst Maxime Stranart told Reuters.",
