Elliott has said the move, which mirrors actions taken by Coca-Cola nearly a decade ago, would increase PepsiCo's margins, allow the $200 billion company to focus on new chips and sodas and turn it into a simpler, more-focused organization.  Earlier this month, Elliott unveiled a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo - one of its largest investments- and released a 75-page report with ideas on how to boost profit at the company, whose share price has tumbled nearly 20% in the last year, underperforming a 2% fall in the broader S&P consumer staples index.",
