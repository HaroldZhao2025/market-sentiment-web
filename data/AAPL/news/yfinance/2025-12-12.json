    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Thursday backed a ruling that held Apple in civil contempt for brazenly defying an order designed to open its iPhone app store to other payment systems besides its own, but the decision also reopened a door for the company to collect commission from the rival options.  The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals mostly validated a scalding contempt order issued in April by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers for violating a key part of her September 2021 findings in a legal battle instigated by video game maker Epic Games.",

The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which includes  Tesla  have accounted for around 43% of the S&P 500’s advance into the end of November, based on data from S&P Dow Jones senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt.  Goldman Sachs still sees the biggest tech stocks driving nearly half of  earnings growth next year, but also expects improvements in the contribution from the s0-called other 493 members of the benchmark.",

        "description": "",
        "summary": "Megacap tech stocks are likely to continue dominating the pace and direction of the S&P 500 next year, according to data from Goldman Sachs, even as investors bet on broader participation from companies outside of the cohort as the economy remains surprisingly resilient.  The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which includes  Tesla  have accounted for around 43% of the S&P 500’s advance into the end of November, based on data from S&P Dow Jones senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt.  Goldman Sachs still sees the biggest tech stocks driving nearly half of  earnings growth next year, but also expects improvements in the contribution from the s0-called other 493 members of the benchmark.",
