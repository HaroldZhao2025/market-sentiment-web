        "summary": "Apple will move some production of its Mac Mini desktop computer to the U.S. from Asia, with a ‌new manufacturing effort set to begin later this year at a ‌Foxconn facility in north Houston, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.  In May, U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on products manufactured overseas, a sharp ‌reversal from earlier policy ⁠when his administration had exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from rounds of tariffs on Chinese imports.  The production for Mac ⁠Mini will continue in Asia, its chief operating officer Sabih Khan told WSJ, adding that the facility will meet local demand as the U.S. assembly line ​ramps ​up.",
