        "description": "",
        "summary": "SEOUL—The U.S. will soon get its first mass-market smartphone that folds not just once, but twice.  Samsung  Electronics’ Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to hit the shelves in the U.S. as early as the first quarter of 2026, after it goes on sale in South Korea and elsewhere this month.  The new phone is the latest salvo in Samsung’s long-running battle with  Apple  which is expected to introduce its own foldable phone—likely a once-folding model—later next year.",
