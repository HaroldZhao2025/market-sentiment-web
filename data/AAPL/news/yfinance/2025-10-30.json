        "summary": "Apple will report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday, as investors hope for good news ahead of the key holiday sales window.  For the period, Wall Street analysts tracked by FactSet are forecasting $1.78 in earnings per share on $102.2 billion in revenue, both up 8% from the year-ago period.  Device sales have been in a slump since Apple’s fiscal 2021, when blowout results were heavily influenced by pandemic-era demand.",
