        "summary": "President Donald Trump’s intervention in Venezuela is shaking up Wall Street—but investors aren’t expecting it to derail the rally.  Markets remain focused on domestic economic strength, supportive fiscal and monetary policy, and artificial-intelligence-driven earnings growth that many believe can extend the bull market into a fourth year.  Geopolitical risks could still weigh on sentiment at times, but investors are betting that a resilient U.S. economy, policy tailwinds, and AI-driven earnings growth will outweigh overseas uncertainty.",
