    "summary": "You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The pros say the US–China tariff thaw is not a deal, but rather a thaw in the ordeal triggered by the Trump administration. Whatever it is, the stock market likes the fact that US tariffs on China will be going down to 30% from 145% for the next 90 days as US and China officials negotiate further. The verdict is out on several fronts, however. For one, tariffs are still in place on China, and there is no guarantee they will all be removed. There is also no guarantee that there won't be a renewed escalation. Two, the US economy has started to weaken in the face of considerable policy uncertainty, and experts are not ruling out a mild recession. What that means for Fed policy will likely dictate how stocks trade throughout the summer. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi welcomes former US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to the Opening Bid roundtable. Ross served in the first Trump administration when the then first-time president enacted tariffs. He has also known Trump for decades, gaining keen insight into how he operates on delicate matters. What's next in the trade war for investors? If there's anyone who might have an educated guess, it's business mogul turned policy expert Ross.
