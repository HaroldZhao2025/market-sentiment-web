      "summary": "STORY: From what next for Nvidia sales in China to $1 AI offers, this is AI Weekly. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday suggested he might allow sales of Nvidia’s next-gen AI chips in China. That’s despite deep-seated fears that China could harness U.S. AI capabilities for its military. Trump said the chips, if sold, would be a scaled-down version.Staying with Washington, firm Anthropic has offered AI chatbot Claude to the U.S. government for $1. The Amazon-backed company joins a growing list of startups proposing lucrative deals to win federal contracts. ChatGPT-owner OpenAI made a similar offer last week of $1 per federal agency for the next year.Elon Musk announced on Monday his AI startup xAI would take legal action against Apple. He accused the iPhone maker of breaching antitrust regulations in managing App Store rankings…Claiming the tech giant has made it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.Perplexity AI made a $34.5 billion all-cash offer for Alphabet's Chrome browser on Tuesday.The bid, which was unsolicited, is far above its own valuation.The startup is reaching for the browser's billions of users pivotal to the AI search race.And Getty Images has filed a landmark lawsuit against Stability AI in London. Getty’s accused the AI company of using its images without permission to “train” its system Stable Diffusion. Stability denies infringing Getty’s rights.  Lawyers say this case will have a major impact on AI copyright law.",
