The plunge has been particularly dramatic in light of the strong showings by software giants like Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., and Palantir Technologies Inc., all of whom are considered to be stronger in AI.  While Salesforce, which makes customer relationship management software, has its own AI products, concerns about its long-term trajectory mean the shares may languish even if the company posts strong earnings when it reports after the bell on Wednesday.",
