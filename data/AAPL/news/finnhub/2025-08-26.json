    "summary": "STORY: Elon Musk’s xAI is suing Apple and OpenAI over claims they conspired to thwart rivals on artificial intelligence.The suit was filed in a Texas court on Monday (August 26).It says the pair “locked up markets to maintain their monopolies” after Apple integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its products.The suit says the partnership led the iPhone maker to promote ChatGPT in its app store, while limiting prominence for Musk’s competing chatbot Grok.In a social media post, Musk said “a million reviews with 4.9 average for Grok and still Apple refuses to mention Grok on any lists”.Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment on the suit.While OpenAI said the case was consistent with what it called Musk’s “ongoing pattern of harassment”.Some legal experts said Apple’s dominant position in the smartphone market could bolster xAI’s allegation that it was suppressing competition.But Ohio State University law professor Amy Schmitz cast doubt on some of Musk’s claims:“The fact remains that Grok is in the app store and it has ranked highly in some months. In fact, one report I looked at had it ranked at, I think, number one on the App Store in February of 2025, which shows that there is competition, right?”Musk cofounded OpenAI with Sam Altman in 2015.Its ChatGPT bot would later become the fastest-growing consumer application in history.But the pair fell out, and Musk went on to found the rival xAI.In a separate case, he’s suing the ChatGPT maker over its plan to convert from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity.",
