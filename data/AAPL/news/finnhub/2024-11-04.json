    "summary": "Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-B, BRK-A) cash holding reached a record $325.2 billion in the third quarter as the firm sells off its stake in companies like Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Portfolio Wealth Advisors president and CIO Lee Munson joins Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith. Munson tells Yahoo Finance that Berkshire's growing cash pile reflects Warren Buffett's strategy to sell high, saying, \"I think you're going to have to see a market that trades much lower in valuation before you get him to do anything. And if he does anything that's not in a market that's getting crushed in its valuation, I think it's because he's going to look at things that he knows best or that are doing best and that's going to be in energy or in some of these industrial aerospace things that have been working well.\" Watch the video above for more on Munson's read of Berkshire's cash holdings and what's next for Warren Buffett.
