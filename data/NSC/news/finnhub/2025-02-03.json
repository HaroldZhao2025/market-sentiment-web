    "summary": "Loop Capital has taken a bearish stance on the transportation sector, issuing multiple downgrades to key stocks on Monday in direct response to the Trump administration's aggressive tariff strategy. Canadian Pacific (CP) and Union Pacific (UNP) were downgraded to Sell from Buy, while Canadian National (CNI) was cut to Sell from Hold. Additionally, FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC), and GXO Logistics (GXO) also saw their ratings reduced to Hold from Buy. Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton dissect the details behind Loop Capital's assessment, exploring the potential inflationary impacts these tariff measures could unleash on the transportation industry.
