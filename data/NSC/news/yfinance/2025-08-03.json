    "summary": "Seven associations of shippers have expressed concern the planned deal would significantly increase the power of the merged railroad to raise prices or reduce service standards, the report said.  Union Pacific said it had spoken with more than 100 customers about \"low cost rail options\" adding they would provide all details to stakeholders in their upcoming Surface Transportation Board filing.  Last month, Union Pacific said it would buy smaller rival Norfolk Southern in an $85 billion deal to create the first U.S. coast-to-coast freight rail operator and reshape the movement of goods from grains to autos across the country.",
