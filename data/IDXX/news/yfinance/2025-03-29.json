    "summary": "Healthcare diagnostics equipment manufacturer, Idexx Laboratories (NASDAQ: IDXX), is the global leader in pet care.  Despite this incredible run, Idexx's current share price is the same as it was in late 2020, despite revenue growing by 50% and free cash flow (FCF) per share rising 87% over the same period.  This divergence between a company's improving financial results and its languishing share price is often a powerful combination for investors -- and I believe that could be the case with Idexx.",
