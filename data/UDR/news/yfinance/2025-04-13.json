    "summary": "For example, American Express has fallen nearly 30% from its early-year highs.  At the other extreme, investors sometimes reach for yield with a company like AGNC Investment, which is down nearly 20% from its peak and yields a huge 16%.  Buying popular stocks that have sold off, but not enough to give them an attractive yield (like American Express), or ultra-high-yield stocks with unreliable dividend histories (like AGNC) could be a setup for disappointment.",
