    "summary": "-Cognizant will delay its annual wage hikes, with pay increases for about 80% of its global workforce now set to take effect on November 1, according to a company statement sent to Reuters in an email on Thursday.  India is a major hub for the IT firm with over two-thirds of its total employees, which are around 343,800.  The annual wage hike was due in August but was delayed due to macroeconomic factors, CFO Jatin Dalal said last month, referring to tariff-related uncertainties.",
