In a filing in the Newark, New Jersey federal court, the SEC said it dismissed claims against Gordon Coburn and Steven Schwartz \"in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter,\" and not on the merits.  The dismissal followed the Department of Justice's April 3 decision to abandon a related criminal case against Coburn and Schwartz.",
