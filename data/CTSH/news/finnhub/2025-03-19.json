    "summary": "Paul Weiss, a large law firm that President Trump recently targeted with an executive order, has been fired by a prominent client facing foreign bribery charges over concerns he could be negatively impacted if he continues to retain the firm.  Steven Schwartz,  the former chief legal officer of Teaneck, N.J.-based  Cognizant Technology Solutions  dropped Paul Weiss in response to Trump’s order, the firm said Wednesday in a filing in federal court in New Jersey asking for permission to withdraw from the case.  Schwartz is scheduled to go on trial next month over his alleged involvement in a scheme to pay $2 million in bribes in India to help obtain permission to build a corporate campus there, but the case is under review after Trump curbed enforcement of the U.S. law against foreign bribery.",
