    "summary": "(Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ended a civil bribery case against two former Cognizant Technology Solutions executives, after President Donald Trump decided to stop enforcing a key anti-corruption law.  In a filing in the Newark, New Jersey federal court, the SEC said it dismissed claims against Gordon Coburn and Steven Schwartz \"in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter,\" and not on the merits.  The dismissal followed the Department of Justice's April 3 decision to abandon a related criminal case against Coburn and Schwartz.",
