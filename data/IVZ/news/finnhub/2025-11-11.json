    "summary": "(Reuters) -Crypto firm Bitwise Asset Management's successful push to launch the first U.S. spot Solana ETF while the Securities and Exchange Commission was shut down has upended the regulatory playbook and forced competitors to rethink their product plans, said industry executives.  On October 28, Bitwise launched Solana Staking ETF which tracks the spot ​price of the sixth largest cryptocurrency, using an untested process that does not require a formal SEC sign-off.  Such ‌\"altcoin\" ETFs could attract $14 billion during their first six months, of which $6 billion could flow into Solana products, JPMorgan has predicted.",
