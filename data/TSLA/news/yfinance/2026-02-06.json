        "summary": "BYD’s Hong Kong-listed shares are down this week after disappointing sales data, extending a selloff that has shaved off more than $60 billion in market value since May. The slump reverberated across EV peers, compounding woes for a stock market also grappling with fresh concerns over taxes and business disruption from artificial intelligence.  Adding to the strain, soaring costs for battery materials and memory chips are likely to squeeze automakers’ margins even further.",
