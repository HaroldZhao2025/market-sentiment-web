    "summary": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that early production rate of the company's Cybercab robotaxi and its ​humanoid robot Optimus will be \"agonizingly slow\" before accelerating over time.  Much ‌of Tesla's $1.39 trillion valuation hinges on investor expectations for its self-driving technology and humanoid ‌robots, even as the company's core revenue and profit continue to come from electric vehicle sales.  Responding to a post on X about Cybercab production beginning in less than 100 days, Musk said the pace of the ramp ⁠depends on complexity, noting ‌that production speed is inversely proportional to the number of new parts and manufacturing steps involved.",
