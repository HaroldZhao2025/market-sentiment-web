        "summary": "Tesla's China-made electric vehicle sales fell 9.9% to 61,497 units in October from a year earlier, reversing a 2.8% increase in September, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed on Tuesday. Sales of the U.S. automaker's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made at its Shanghai \"gigafactory\", including exports to Europe, India and other markets, dropped 32.3% from September. Its biggest Chinese rival, BYD, posted a 12% drop in global vehicle sales last month, a second consecutive month of decline and the steepest fall in nearly two years amid hyper-competition in the home market.",
