    "summary": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the company's latest product innovations at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), including self-driving cars and humanoid robots. Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC, joins Catalysts to discuss this development. O'Donnell characterizes Nvidia's entry into robotics as \"a long-term play,\" noting that \"it won't happen overnight.\" He references Nvidia's early involvement in autonomous vehicles, stating, \"frankly they were a little too early,\" but suggests their head start with such technology means \"now they're coming in much more strongly.\" Highlighting Nvidia's \"Cosmos\" release, an artificial intelligence (AI) software platform that \"allows you to do gen AI for physical actions.\" In other words, users can train robots, autonomous vehicles, and other devices \"to react and do analog things in the physical world.\" He emphasizes its significance, adding, \"That's been a huge stopping point for robotics, and that's why it's a big deal and will have a payoff.\" Drawing a parallel to other tech giants, O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance, \"We think about Microsoft (MSFT) on the Windows side, and we think about Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) on the mobile phone side, and maybe Nvidia becomes sort of the platform for robotics.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

      "summary": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the company's latest product innovations at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), including self-driving cars and humanoid robots. Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC, joins Catalysts to discuss this development. O'Donnell characterizes Nvidia's entry into robotics as \"a long-term play,\" noting that \"it won't happen overnight.\" He references Nvidia's early involvement in autonomous vehicles, stating, \"frankly they were a little too early,\" but suggests their head start with such technology means \"now they're coming in much more strongly.\" Highlighting Nvidia's \"Cosmos\" release, an artificial intelligence (AI) software platform that \"allows you to do gen AI for physical actions.\" In other words, users can train robots, autonomous vehicles, and other devices \"to react and do analog things in the physical world.\" He emphasizes its significance, adding, \"That's been a huge stopping point for robotics, and that's why it's a big deal and will have a payoff.\" Drawing a parallel to other tech giants, O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance, \"We think about Microsoft (MSFT) on the Windows side, and we think about Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) on the mobile phone side, and maybe Nvidia becomes sort of the platform for robotics.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
