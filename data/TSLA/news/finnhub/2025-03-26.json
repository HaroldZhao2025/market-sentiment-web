      "summary": "Former  Tesla  finance chief  Zach Kirkhorn  led a recent funding round in Jolly, a startup that aims to help companies improve employee productivity through rewards, and joined its board in his first major venture since leaving the automaker in 2023.  Kirkhorn served as the lead investor in Jolly’s $16.5 million Series A round in January, marking his first time leading funding for a company, and the board appointment signaled his continuing involvement with the startup that was founded in 2022 by a former Tesla intern, Dean Zimberg.  Kirkhorn stepped down as Tesla’s CFO in 2023, after four years as finance chief and 13 years at the company helping transform Tesla into the world’s most valuable carmaker.",
