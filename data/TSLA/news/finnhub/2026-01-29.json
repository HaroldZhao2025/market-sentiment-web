    "summary": "STORY: Meta, Microsoft and Tesla kicked off a wave of Big Tech earnings Wednesday, and it was the Facebook parent company that did most to wow investors. Meta saw ad revenues surge and forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations. It also boosted capital expenditure plans by 73% in pursuit of \"superintelligence\", or where machines surpass human performance.The company will spend up to $135 billion, largely on AI infrastructure. Meta shares rose 10% in extended trading following the numbers. Microsoft also reported a big increase in capital expenditure.But growth slowed at its cloud computing unit, damping investor hopes for a big payoff from the massive spending on artificial intelligence.The Windows maker has enjoyed an advantage in the AI race thanks to its early bet on OpenAI.But it faces growing competition from rivals like Google and AI agents such as Anthropic’s Claude Cowork.They threaten both Microsoft’s AI business and its core software products. Shares in the firm dropped over 6% in after-hours trade as investors weighed up the numbers. There was a mixed picture at Tesla too. Elon Musk's company says it will invest $2 billion in his AI outfit, xAI.It also says production of its Cybercab robotaxi remains on track for this year.The news bolsters Musk’s push to reposition Tesla as an AI and robotics company, in a shift that underpins its roughly $1.5 trillion valuation.But flagging sales of EVs saw revenue fall about 3% in 2025, marking the company’s first annual decline.Demand has been hit as rivals roll out newer models and some buyers are put off by Musk's often contentious rhetoric. Tesla shares rose about 1.8% in after‑hours trade.",

      "summary": "STORY: Meta, Microsoft and Tesla kicked off a wave of Big Tech earnings Wednesday, and it was the Facebook parent company that did most to wow investors. Meta saw ad revenues surge and forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations. It also boosted capital expenditure plans by 73% in pursuit of \"superintelligence\", or where machines surpass human performance.The company will spend up to $135 billion, largely on AI infrastructure. Meta shares rose 10% in extended trading following the numbers. Microsoft also reported a big increase in capital expenditure.But growth slowed at its cloud computing unit, damping investor hopes for a big payoff from the massive spending on artificial intelligence.The Windows maker has enjoyed an advantage in the AI race thanks to its early bet on OpenAI.But it faces growing competition from rivals like Google and AI agents such as Anthropic’s Claude Cowork.They threaten both Microsoft’s AI business and its core software products. Shares in the firm dropped over 6% in after-hours trade as investors weighed up the numbers. There was a mixed picture at Tesla too. Elon Musk's company says it will invest $2 billion in his AI outfit, xAI.It also says production of its Cybercab robotaxi remains on track for this year.The news bolsters Musk’s push to reposition Tesla as an AI and robotics company, in a shift that underpins its roughly $1.5 trillion valuation.But flagging sales of EVs saw revenue fall about 3% in 2025, marking the company’s first annual decline.Demand has been hit as rivals roll out newer models and some buyers are put off by Musk's often contentious rhetoric. Tesla shares rose about 1.8% in after‑hours trade.",
