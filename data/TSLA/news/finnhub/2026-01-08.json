So as we're driving, as we are testing, both on road and in simulations, it gets better and better at driving. So that means we can really quickly deploy it into new places, put it on new types of vehicles for logistics or for robotaxis or even maybe some day for personally owned vehicles. For Lucid, the robotaxi offers growth beyond regular electric cars for consumers. The company has been battling slower EV demand and mounting competition.It recently reported 2025 deliveries slightly above estimates, but production was much higher than sales.Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff says the plan is to tap new markets.:: Marc Winterhoff, CEO of Lucid Group\"Before, we were focusing on B2C customers, you know, the regular cars for you and me, which we still do obviously. But now with that cooperation with Uber and others to come, we're now opening the robotaxi market for us.
