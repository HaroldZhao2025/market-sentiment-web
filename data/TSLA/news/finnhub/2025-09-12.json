The proposed tariff, announced on Wednesday, targets electric and gasoline cars imported from all countries that Mexico doesn’t have a free trade agreement with, including South Korea, India, Indonesia and Russia.  In practice, however, the tariff would mostly impact electric cars manufactured in China and sold in Mexico, industry analysts said.",
