FedEx gained 3.5% before the bell after reporting quarterly profit and revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as cost-cutting and strength in domestic deliveries helped offset weaker international volumes.  Peer United Parcel Service, which abandoned its bid for Mexican parcel company Estafeta, also gained 1.3%.",
