      "summary": "(Reuters) -Telo Trucks has raised $20 million in an oversubscribed Series A round to make its compact electric pickup, as the startup bets on a capital-efficient model to succeed in a market littered with failed EV challengers.  The funding, led by Telo co-founder and designer Yves Béhar and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, shows investors are still willing to back entrants despite a string of bankruptcies that followed the post-pandemic EV listing boom.  Other investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, E12 Ventures and Nova Threshold, Telo said on Tuesday.",
