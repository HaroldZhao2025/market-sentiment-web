It has a giant battery on board and it gives you hours of fun out on the water without any of the fumes, any of the of noise, any maintenance burdens of a gas boat.\"“On the water, the Arc Sport gives you an experience that is quieter, you don't have the fumes from a gas engine. It's more performant, you have so much more power and torque available to you. It's all software enabled, and it's actually cheaper to operate. More convenient to charge a boat overnight than it is to lug gas cans down to the dock. And then once you take it off of the water, you don't have the maintenance headaches, you don't need to winterize it.\"According to Lee, on a single charge, the boat can handle four to six hours of active use, with an overnight charge on a Level 2 charger delivering a full battery by morning.Beyond the powertrain, Arc leans heavily into software.“With one touch of a button, you can configure the balance system, the control surfaces, the cruise control for it, to throw that perfect surf wave on one side of the boat or the other.\"\"I think that electric boats make even more sense, that electric cars have pretty stiff competition in gas cars. Those gas cars are reliable, they're inexpensive, they are convenient, they are quiet, they've had a bunch of money put into R&D over the span of 100 years. Gas boats are not the same level of competition. And by going electric, you solve a bunch of very acute pain points with owning a gas boat.\"But Arc's technology comes at a premium.The Arc Sport EV boat starts at $268,000.Yet Lee says demand has not been an issue, with the wake sport boat being just the beginning.“We've already announced our next product that comes after this, which is a center console boat for fishing and leisure activities, and have also expanded into the commercial space as well. Larger vessels, harbor craft, you can think of tugboats and ferries, so taking that same technology and scaling it up to those applications.\"",
