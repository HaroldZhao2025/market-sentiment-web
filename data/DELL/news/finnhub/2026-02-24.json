Like peers such as Dell, HP has also taken steps ​including supply chain adjustments and price increases to mitigate the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's flip-flopping tariffs and rising memory chip prices. That helped it beat Wall Street estimates for first-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, driven by growing adoption of AI-powered ‌personal computers and the ongoing ⁠Windows 11 upgrade cycle.",
