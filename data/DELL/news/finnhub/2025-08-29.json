They're probably going to beat, and stocks are probably going to go down because the expectations that are built into this company are just enormous. When you're over a $4 trillion company, how fast can you keep growing? They grew at 56%, and the markets were, 'Wow, that's the slowest we've seen in a while.' Yeah, the law of big numbers says you can't... If you keep growing at 50%, you will become the world at some point. So, it is going to have to slow.\"Other stock moves included U.S. shares of Alibaba, which soared 13% after the Chinese company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly growth in its cloud computing business, driven by AI-related demand.The Wall Street Journal also reported that Alibaba has developed a new AI chip.On the flip side, chipmaker Marvell slumped almost 19% after forecasting quarterly revenue below expectations.The stock market will be closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday.",
