Baker Hughes said oil rigs rose by one to 412 this week, while gas rigs fell by one to 122.  The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.",
