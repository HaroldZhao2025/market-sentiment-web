U.S. energy companies are producing record amounts of oil, much of it from onshore shale fields.  New techniques and technology, like longer lateral wells, automation and more powerful equipment, have driven productivity gains across the industry that have allowed oil companies to pump more with fewer rigs and less capital.",
