Energy-intensive data centers, which are used to produce the next wave of artificial intelligence technologies, are driving U.S. power demand to record highs and propelling the advancement of electricity sources that had been in decline or sparsely used.  CTR has been working on the development of its \"Hell's Kitchen\" geothermal power and critical minerals project for roughly 13 years.",
