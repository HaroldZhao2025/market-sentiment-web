    "summary": "China will restrict beef imports as it seeks to protect domestic farmers and producers, dealing a blow to Brazil and Australia, as well as major meat producers in the US.  A series of quotas will be in effect from Jan. 1, after authorities determined that rising imports had harmed China’s own industry.  The trade measures, which follow an investigation launched in December 2024, are likely to restrict flows of beef into the world’s top importer, and could hurt producers and cattle farmers elsewhere.",
