The herd dwindled to its smallest size on record this summer after a years-long drought dried up pastures used for grazing, forcing meat companies like Tyson to pay more to buy cattle to slaughter.  However, Tyson benefited in the quarter that ended on June 28 from increased sales volumes and prices for its chicken.",
