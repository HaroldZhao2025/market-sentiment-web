        "summary": "Tiger Global Management and Adage Capital Partners were among investors that trimmed their holdings of some AI heavyweights including Nvidia and Amazon during the fourth quarter of 2025, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures.  The quarterly 13-F filings provide insight into how some ‌major investors have been reacting to growing worries that valuations of the \"Magnificent 7\" AI giants -- a cohort that also includes Meta and Microsoft -- have become stretched and that their ‌massive spending on AI technology will fail to generate sufficient returns.",
