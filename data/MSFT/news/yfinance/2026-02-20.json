        "summary": "Mutual fund managers who cut exposure to the volatile tech stocks that have roiled markets this year have been on a tear.  Nearly 60% of large-cap mutual funds are outperforming their benchmarks, the highest share since 2007, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Large-cap core and growth managers have posted the strongest gains, helped in part by weak returns from Big Tech.  Tech companies in the index are down more than 4%, while energy and materials producers have rallied at least 15%.",
