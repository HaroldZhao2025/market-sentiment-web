        "summary": "EU antitrust regulators will decide by ​February 10 whether to clear ‌Alphabet's $32 billion acquisition of cybersecurity company Wiz, ‌its largest deal ever, according to a filing on the European Commission website.  Alphabet announced the deal ⁠in March ‌last year as it doubles down on cybersecurity to ‍sharpen its edge in the cloud-computing race against Amazon.com and Microsoft.  The Commission, which acts as the EU competition enforcer, can ⁠either clear the ​deal with or ​without demanding concessions during its preliminary review, or it can ‍open a ⁠full-scale investigation if it has serious concerns.",
