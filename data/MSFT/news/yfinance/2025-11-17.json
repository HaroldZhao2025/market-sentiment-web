While the credit insurance rises in value in tandem with the perceived risk of ‌a company's default, current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors.  Saba sold banks CDSs on Oracle, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, said the source, who had direct knowledge of the deals.",
