        "summary": "“We see more competitors coming for the juicy profit margins of the Magnificent 7,” and expect that the productivity and profit margins of the rest of the S&P 500 will be boosted by tech, said Wall Street research veteran Ed Yardeni.  The Magnificent 7 stocks were mixed in premarket trading on Monday, with Tesla Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp. underperforming peers.  The Magnificent 7 merits special caution as “they’re competing more aggressively against each other and they’ve got more competition coming out of nowhere” Yardeni said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday.",
