      "summary": "STORY: Big Tech earnings so far this week have sent a clear warning: investors are willing to overlook soaring spending on artificial intelligence if it fuels strong growth, but are quick to punish companies that fall short.The contrast was clear in Thursday's stock market reaction to earnings from Microsoft and Meta.The Facebook and Instagram parent jumped as much as 11% Thursday morning on strong sales.While Microsoft slumped 12% after its cloud business failed to impress.Meta has said it is benefiting from AI bolstered ad targeting. That contributed to a 24% boost in quarterly revenue and a rosy first-quarter forecast.   The results show that its gains from AI were helping fund its capital spending, which is expected to jump as much as 87% to $135 billion this year.Microsoft benefitted from its first-mover advantage with its investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI to become the world's most valuable firm in 2024.But that has morphed into a possible drawback as OpenAI faces increased competition including from Google's Gemini which has won over massive customers such as Apple.Now Microsoft is under growing investor pressure to justify its soaring capital outlay.Microsoft reported revenue growth in its Azure cloud-computing business that was only slightly above expectations.But despite Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's insistence that AI remains in the \"early innings,\" the company has spent more than $200 billion on the technology since the start of its fiscal 2024, and investor patience is waning.",
