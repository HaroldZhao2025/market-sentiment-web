From an entrepreneur to trying to reinvent a claim to fame to win in the era of artificial intelligence. This is where we find Ring's chief inventor, Jamie Siminoff. Siminoff founded Ring in 2013, which he later sold to tech giant Amazon in 2018 for $1.15 billion. Ring has since developed a host of connected security products from floodlights to new iterations of its iconic connected doorbell. Siminoff left Amazon in 2023, only to return in early 2025 to lead its suite of security products. He is said to be tasked with taking the connected security platform to new heights by leveraging AI while driving a more efficient business. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with Siminoff on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast to discuss what he is working on at Amazon, what motivates him as an inventor, and leadership lessons learned from building a consumer product hung from most doors in the US.
