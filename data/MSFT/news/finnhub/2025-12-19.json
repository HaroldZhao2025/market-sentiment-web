      "summary": "The wait for Yahoo Finance's 2025 Company of the Year is over, and the winner is private artificial intelligence giant and ChatGPT parent company OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). D.A. Davidson's head of technology research, Gil Luria, told Yahoo Finance last week that stakeholder Microsoft (MSFT) will be the biggest gainer from OpenAI's success, while Oracle (ORCL) may have the most to lose if OpenAI's artificial intelligence visions don't pan out. Epistrophy Capital Research Chief Market Strategist Cory Johnson explains Oracle's business strategy while managing its debt. Johnson is also the host of The Drill Down Podcast. Be sure to watch Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi's full interview with OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar. Also catch Cory Johnson explain why the market may have been over-reliant on whether OpenAI performed in 2025 or not.
