It is also one of the most difficult things to do successfully. Whether you’re opening a local ice cream shop or looking to launch the next Microsoft (MSFT), you’ll need a plan, one that involves financing. But how do entrepreneurs acquire the funds to start a venture? This is the “startup stage” – when entrepreneurs are raising capital to launch their business and reinvesting their profits into the business to fuel growth. According to the US Chamber of Commerce, 69% of small businesses rely on their personal savings to fund their business. In a groundbreaking 4-episode series, Yahoo Finance explores the world of entrepreneurship by delving into a specific stage of each small business-building process through inspiring stories from those who have navigated this journey. The second episode features Ras Plant Based, a vegan Ethiopian restaurant founded by a culinary duo who got creative with funding and quickly created a profitable restaurant. If you missed the first episode of FEARLESS, where Talea Beer Co dives into its “concept stage” — the first step in starting a new business — you can watch it here.
