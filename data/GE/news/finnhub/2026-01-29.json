    "summary": "The new global minimum corporate tax took a bite out of GE Aerospace's bottom line last year and prompted the company to pay more taxes in Singapore.  GE Aerospace was hit by Singapore's adoption of a 15% minimum tax as part of the deal.  Last year, however, because of the global agreement, that benefit was $121 million smaller than it otherwise would have been, according to the company's filing.",
