    "summary": "In a presentation to investors in New York, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik said the company was still not taking new orders for offshore wind turbines and forecast more losses in its wind segment in 2025.  \"We aren't going to chase bad deals,\" he said on stage, adding that the power equipment maker was expecting little to no growth in onshore wind for the next three years.  GE Vernova's wind division has lost hundreds of millions of dollars this year due to delays at major offshore projects in the United States and the United Kingdom because of accidents involving its turbines.",
