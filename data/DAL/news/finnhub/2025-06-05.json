    "summary": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines warned new tariffs on imported airplanes and parts could force the airline to stop buying foreign-made planes impacting millions of customers. The Atlanta-based carrier told the U.S. Commerce Department in comments seen by Reuters Thursday that in 2023 and 2024 it took delivery of 47 Airbus aircraft produced in Canada, Germany and France. If the carrier had not been able to take delivery of those planes because of tariffs it would have forced flight cancellations impacting 10 million customers.",
