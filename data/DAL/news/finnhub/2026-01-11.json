Larger carriers such as  United Airlines  and  Delta Air Lines  have deployed their own bare-bones fares to lure bargain hunters while catering to faster-growing demand from well-heeled travelers willing to pay up for extras.  Allegiant and Sun Country have been able to steer clear of some of the difficulties that have plagued the low-cost end of the airline industry by being more selective about where and when they fly.",
