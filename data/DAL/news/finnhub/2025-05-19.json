    "summary": "(Reuters) -Delta Air Lines can pursue much of its lawsuit seeking to hold cybersecurity company CrowdStrike liable for a massive computer outage last July that caused the carrier to cancel 7,000 flights, a Georgia state judge ruled.  In a decision on Friday, Judge Kelly Lee Ellerbe of the Fulton County Superior Court said Delta can try to prove CrowdStrike was grossly negligent in pushing a defective update of its Falcon software to customers, crashing more than 8 million Microsoft Windows-based computers worldwide.  \"Delta has specifically pled that if CrowdStrike had tested the July update on one computer before its deployment, the programming error would have been detected,\" the judge wrote.",
