    "summary": "Analysts are saying that Delta Air Lines could rise by 2030, with long-term forecasts pointing to meaningful upside as the airline leans on premium travel demand and high-margin loyalty revenue. If you're bullish on DAL, SoFi lets you trade Delta stock with zero commissions, and new users who fund their account can receive up to 1,000 dollars in stock. You can also earn a 1 percent bonus when transferring investments and keeping them with SoFi through December 31, 2025 — a limited-time incentive",
