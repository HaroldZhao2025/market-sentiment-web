Bastian told investors that refunds “grew significantly” as bookings also slowed amid the uncertainty in air travel caused by the 43-day shutdown, contributing to Delta's loss of about 25 cents per share.  The shutdown, which began Oct. 1, led to long delays at major airports and historic flight cancellations at 40 of the country's busiest airports as more unpaid air traffic controllers missed work, citing additional stress and the need to take on side jobs.",
