    "summary": "(Reuters) -Apple urged a federal judge to dismiss a racketeering lawsuit by a company that accused the iPhone maker of stealing its technology to create the lucrative mobile wallet Apple Pay.  In a Monday night filing in Atlanta federal court, Apple said if the case is not dismissed, it should be transferred to a Texas judge who recently dismissed Fintiv's related patent case.  Fintiv, based in Austin, Texas, accused Apple of misappropriating technology for Apple Pay that it had once sought to license from CorFire, a Georgia company that Fintiv bought in 2014.",
