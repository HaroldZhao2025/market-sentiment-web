    "summary": "(Reuters) -Capital One has agreed to pay $425 million to settle nationwide litigation accusing it of cheating savings account depositors out of much higher interest rates by not telling them they could move their money to higher-yielding accounts.  Depositors said Capital One falsely promised high interest rates on its 360 Savings accounts while quietly offering much better rates to new customers on the similarly named 360 Performance Savings accounts.  The 360 Savings depositors said Capital One froze their rates at 0.3% while offering rates to 360 Performance Savings depositors that peaked at 4.35% early last year.",
