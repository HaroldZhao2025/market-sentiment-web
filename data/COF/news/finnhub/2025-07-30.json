The San Mateo, California-based startup has pitched itself as a one-stop alternative to data monitoring and analytics tools from Datadog and Cisco-owned Splunk, aiming to simplify how businesses detect failures in complex systems.  It stores all customer data in a single, central \"lake\" built on Snowflake and offers a lower-cost alternative to larger rivals, a strategy that has helped it attract about 100 clients, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia.",
