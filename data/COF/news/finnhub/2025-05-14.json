    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Capital One was sued on Wednesday by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who accused the bank of cheating depositors with its flagship \"high interest\" savings accounts out of millions of dollars in interest.  The lawsuit followed the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's decision in late February to drop a similar lawsuit, following a change in that agency's leadership and U.S. President Donald Trump's return to the White House.  In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, James said Capital One promised depositors one of the country's highest interest rates on their 360 Savings accounts, yet froze their rate at just 0.30% even as interest rates rose nationwide.",
