The oil and gas corporation based in Texas filed its complaint Friday in the U.S. Eastern District Court for California.  In its complaint, ExxonMobil says it has for years publicly disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related business risks, but it fundamentally disagrees with the state’s new reporting requirements.",
