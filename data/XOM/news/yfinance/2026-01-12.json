President Trump is aiming to convince oil executives to support his plans in Venezuela, a country whose energy resources he says he expects to control for years to come. U.S. forces seized Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in a sweeping military operation on Jan. 3, with Trump making no secret that control of Venezuela's oil was at the heart of his actions.
