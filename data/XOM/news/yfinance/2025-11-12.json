        "summary": "The company is in exclusive talks with the data center’s end user, which it didn’t name, and anticipates making a final investment decision early next year, according to a statement and presentation released ahead of Chevron’s investor day on Wednesday.  Big Oil is looking to cash in on the enormous demand for energy that will be needed to power data centers, which are being located further away from major population centers and closer to sources of fuel.  Chevron is one of the biggest producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas, which spews out so much natural gas that it often overwhelms pipelines and has to be burned off.",
