Since it started exporting oil in early 2020, the burgeoning oil nation has emerged as the fifth largest Latin American crude exporter after Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia.  But unlike Latin America's usual offer of heavy sour oil, Guyana's lighter and sweeter crude grades have carved out a rising share in Europe, where most refineries are not as complex as the majority of Latin American and U.S. Gulf Coast plants that turn heavy grades into motor fuels.",
