    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Top U.S. oil major ExxonMobil asked regulators to block changes proposed by the Colonial Pipeline to its fuel shipping terms, citing potential harm to shippers and consumers, a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) showed.  The Colonial Pipeline, a key 5,500-mile (8,851 km) artery for shipping fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the East Coast, this month sought approval from FERC to stop shipping different grades of gasoline at the same time and to reduce the total number of grades it moves on the pipeline.  The changes would mark one of the most significant overhauls on the longest U.S. fuel pipeline, which Colonial says will help it ship more fuel by streamlining operations and minimizing slowdowns.",
