    "summary": "(Reuters) -Exxon Mobil filed a lawsuit on Monday against California Attorney General Rob Bonta and several environmental groups, court records show, accusing them of defaming and disparaging the oil giant's advanced plastics recycling initiatives.  The lawsuit is a sign of how Exxon is increasingly fighting back against environmentalists and other critics who have brought lawsuits against the company alleging its involvement in climate change and rising greenhouse gas emissions.  Filed in federal court in Beaumont, Texas, the lawsuit accused Bonta of acting in concert with a law firm called Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, LLP that has ties to IEJF, an Australian non-profit controlled by billionaire Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest's company Minderoo Foundation.",
