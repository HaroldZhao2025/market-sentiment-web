The floating vessel named One Guyana brings the joint venture a step closer to its target of 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030 from the prolific block, one of the biggest oil discoveries in years that has driven soaring profits for the joint venture.  Chevron closed its acquisition of Hess, which held a 30% stake in the consortium, in July after prevailing in a lengthy legal battle with Exxon that centered on access to the block, where more than 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas have been found since 2015.",
