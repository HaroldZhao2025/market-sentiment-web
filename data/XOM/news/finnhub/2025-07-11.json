Inventories of crude oil along the U.S. Gulf Coast had fallen to their lowest seasonally in seven years at the end of last week, thanks to recent wildfires in Canada that cut supplies and cancellations of licenses that allowed for U.S. import of Venezuelan crude.  The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday said it would provide up to 1 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to Exxon Mobil's Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana, citing an offshore supply disruption.",
