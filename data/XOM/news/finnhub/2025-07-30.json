    "summary": "RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Energy companies operating in Brazil are expected to resume oil shipments to the United States after several oil products were exempted from U.S. tariffs, the head of Brazilian oil lobby group IBP told Reuters on Wednesday.  Oil is Brazil's top export to the U.S. and was exempt from the 10% April tariff imposed on Brazilian exports, but uncertainty over whether the commodity would be exempt under new tariffs announced on July 9 led to a halt in shipments for most of the month.  However, while President Donald Trump's decree on Wednesday hiked tariffs against Brazil to 50%, it excluded several major Brazilian exports from the measures, which included orange juice, some aircraft, pulp and energy products.",
