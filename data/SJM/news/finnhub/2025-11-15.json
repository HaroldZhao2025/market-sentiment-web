    "summary": "President Donald Trump issued an executive order late on Friday to roll back tariffs on dozens of imported agricultural goods that aren’t made in large-enough quantities in the United States.  The tariff rollback is a relief to companies, from restaurant chains to packaged foods makers, that have seen their input prices rise in the past few months.  In its latest quarterly earnings report, Starbucks said its operating margins had shrunk by 5 percentage points year over year to 9.4% largely because of inflation and tariffs.",
