    "summary": "Amid ongoing concerns about trade war escalations and heightened geopolitical tensions, some investors are opting to focus on domestic names. Villere & Co. portfolio manager George Young tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime that he is focused on domestic companies but says he's willing to make an exception for this copper mining company: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX). Young says, \"We're looking at 'Domestically, what can we do? What can our clients do? Where are the profits available?'\" The portfolio manager notes that Freeport is \"an exception because the demand for copper is pretty permanent.\" He explains the long life of copper mines compared to other commodity sources and the \"difficult\" location of the metal as driving factors making the mining stock attractive. He adds, \"There's no substitute for copper\" and \"nothing else can replicate copper.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.
