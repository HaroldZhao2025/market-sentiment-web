The company introduced its new Rubin chip platform, designed around next generation memory technology for inference workloads. Samsung and Micron are set to supply HBM4 memory for Nvidia's new GPU platforms, signaling changes in its component supply chain. Recent U.S. policy signals on legacy AI chip exports to China may affect how Nvidia serves that market. NVIDIA...",
