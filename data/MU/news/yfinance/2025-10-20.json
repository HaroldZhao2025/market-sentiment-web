    "summary": "SEOUL (Reuters) -The global rush by chipmakers to produce AI chips is tightening supply of less glamorous chips used in smartphones, computers and servers, spurring panic buying by some customers and a surge in their prices, industry executives and analysts said.  The unexpected ripple effect of the AI boom is giving a much-needed boost to memory chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics, which has lagged rivals in offering advanced AI chips and a rally in their share prices.  Supply of the more mundane semiconductors has become so tight that the global memory chip industry is poised to head into what some analysts call a \"super cycle\", as device makers frantically stock up on memory chips, executives said.",
