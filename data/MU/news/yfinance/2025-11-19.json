In the past two months, electronics supply chains around the world have been hit by a shortage ‌of legacy memory chips as manufacturers turned their focus to high-end memory chips suited to semiconductors designed for AI applications.  Nvidia recently decided to reduce AI server power costs by ⁠changing the kind of memory chip ‌it uses to LPDDR, a type of low-power memory chip normally found in phones and tablets, from DDR5, which are typically ‍used in servers.",
