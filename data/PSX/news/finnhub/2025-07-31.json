A state court in Alameda, California, on Wednesday ordered Phillips 66 to pay $195 million in punitive damages, in addition to $604.9 million in compensation the refiner was ordered to pay following a separate verdict.  In October, a jury in the California court decided that Houston-based Phillips 66 stole trade secrets under the guise of gathering information for a potential acquisition and then used that information to create a competing business.",

Top U.S. refiners were expected to post higher second-quarter profits, rebounding from first-quarter losses as stronger-than-expected diesel margins lifted earnings.
