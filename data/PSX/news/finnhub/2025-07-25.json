      "summary": "Refiner Phillips 66 beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter profit on Friday, helped by higher refining margins and lower turnaround expenses. Top U.S. refiners were expected to post higher second-quarter profit, rebounding from losses in the prior quarter as stronger-than-expected diesel margins lifted earnings. The improved margins helped peers such as Valero Energy surpass Wall Street estimates.",
