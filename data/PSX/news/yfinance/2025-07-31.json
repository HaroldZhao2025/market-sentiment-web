    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. refiner Phillips 66 was ordered to pay biofuel maker Propel Fuels $800 million in damages for stealing trade secrets to build up its renewable-fuel capabilities, according to a California state court document.  A state court in Alameda, California, on Wednesday ordered Phillips 66 to pay $195 million in punitive damages, in addition to $604.9 million in compensation the refiner was ordered to pay following a separate verdict.  In October, a jury in the California court decided that Houston-based Phillips 66 stole trade secrets under the guise of gathering information for a potential acquisition and then used that information to create a competing business.",
