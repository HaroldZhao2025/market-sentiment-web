    "summary": "Blackstone has dropped plans to acquire a majority stake in the snacks business of India's Haldiram's but is now discussing purchase of a 20% stake at a valuation of $8 billion, which is still a sticking point, sources told Reuters on Thursday.  Haldiram's, which Euromonitor International estimates has a share of almost 13% of India's $6.2-billion market for savoury snacks, has more than 150 restaurants, but many foreign investors are salivating over its popular snacks business.  In May Reuters reported a consortium led by Blackstone was eyeing a stake of 75% in the business and had made a non-binding bid, but those talks did not materialise as Haldiram's is no longer keen to sell a big stake, said the sources, who sought anonymity as the discussions are private.",
