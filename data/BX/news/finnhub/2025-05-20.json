    "summary": "LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Blackstone has kicked off the sale of Clarion Events, four people familiar with the matter said, in a test of demand for takeovers after weeks of market turmoil stymied dealmaking.  Blackstone bought Clarion, which runs international trade shows in electronics, gaming, energy, security and defence, in 2017 for 600 million pounds ($802 million) and supported it through the COVID pandemic, when the events industry came to a sudden halt, hammering the company's revenue and earnings.  The U.S.-based private equity fund distributed information memoranda earlier this month and has drawn interest from funds including CVC, KKR, PAI Partners and Ardian, the four people said, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
