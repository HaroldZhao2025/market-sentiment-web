A day earlier, another firm,  Ares Management  also reported earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up more than 4% that day.  The market reaction suggested that investor concern had diminished in the nearly two weeks since  Blackstone  reported earnings and private-credit fears weighed on its shares.",
