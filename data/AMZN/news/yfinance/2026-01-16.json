        "summary": "The race to build up more AI data centers has created a strain on the existing power grid while also bottlenecking the ambitious plans of the world’s largest tech companies.  AI systems consume far more energy than more typical servers and other computing gear, but new energy generation facilities don’t exactly go up overnight.  In a landmark deal, Google-parent  Alphabet  last month agreed to buy renewable energy developer Intersect Power for $4.75 billion, plus the assumption of debt.",
