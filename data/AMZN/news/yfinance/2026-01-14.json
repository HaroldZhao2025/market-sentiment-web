On Monday, Italy's antitrust authority said it had ⁠reduced to 752.4 ‌million euros ($876.3 million) a 1.13-billion-euro fine it imposed on Amazon in ‍2021 for abusing its dominant position, restricting competition in e-commerce logistics services in Italy.  The reduction ​followed a regional administrative court ruling last ‌September.",
