    "summary": "24/7 Wall St. Analysts Eric Bleeker and Austin Smith are kicking the New Year off in style with 12 trends for AI investors to watch in 2026. Over the course of 12 videos, the two will share their thoughts on everything from the memory explosion to software stocks to robotics. In this video, Eric takes a deeper look at the rise of AI factories, massive data centers with a capacity of more than 1 gigawatt. As Eric notes, it's not just Oracle's Stargate getting into the race. There are also new super factories from Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and many others. Companies with data center cooling portfolios like Vertiv (NYSE: VRT), nVent Electric (NYSE: NVT), Modine Manufacturing (NYSE: MOD) could be winners as the construction of this new generation of data centers takes off.",
