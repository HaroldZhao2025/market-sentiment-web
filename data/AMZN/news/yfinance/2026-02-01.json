    "summary": "Microsoft Corp. reported solid earnings on Wednesday, but investors zeroed in on stagnating growth in its Azure cloud-computing business and the more than $100 billion it’s expected to dole out in capital spending this year.  When all was said and done, Microsoft posted its worst week since March 2020.  “In a normal world, these results would be pretty good, but in the backdrop of the scale of spending, with things priced for perfection, you really have to hit your marks,” said Josh Chastant, portfolio manager of public investments at GuideStone Funds, which owns a stake in Microsoft.",
