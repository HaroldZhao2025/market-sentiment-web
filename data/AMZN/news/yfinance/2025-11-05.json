The e-commerce giant is accusing Perplexity of committing computer fraud by failing to disclose when Comet is shopping on a real person’s behalf, in violation of Amazon’s terms of service, according to the complaint in San Francisco federal court.  Amazon is introducing a dispute after sending a cease-and-desist letter to the startup Friday, accusing the smaller company of degrading the Amazon shopping experience and introduced privacy vulnerabilities, people familiar with the matter have said.",
