The club based out of Augusta, GA has welcomed members like NFL superstars Peyton and Eli Manning, Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy, Delta Airlines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian, Bill Gates, and even former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, to name a few. But Augusta National operates differently from a standard run-of-the-mill country club. This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano takes a deeper look into the acclaimed golf club and breaks down why membership at Augusta National is so coveted. The club, which caps at 300 members, only opens up new membership opportunities when previous spots open up, meaning a member would have to either die or withdraw their membership in order for someone new to join. Potential members must also be nominated by someone who is already a member of the club. If admitted into Augusta National, not only will members have to pay a $40,000 initiation fee, but they also need to abide by rules regarding dress code, gameplay, and much more. To hear more, check out this week’s episode of Yahoo Finance Sports report here.
