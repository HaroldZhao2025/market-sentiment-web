The economy: While markets have mostly rebounded from their April lows, many Americans say the economic pain hasn't eased. Between tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation to the lingering effects of the government shutdown, the outlook for 2026 remains murky. \"I know a lot of new grads who are having a really hard time getting jobs,\" said Katie, a sales rep at ReportPass. \"I think that's a good sign of the economy ... going down.\" AI's rapid rise: AI has officially gone mainstream, and it's not slowing down anytime soon.

As the technology races ahead, New Yorkers are asking: Should we embrace it fully, or start pumping the brakes?
