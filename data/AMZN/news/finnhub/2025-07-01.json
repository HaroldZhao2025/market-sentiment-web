    "headline": "Price rises for Chinese goods outpacing inflation on US Amazon: study",
    "summary": "STORY: Prices for goods made in China and sold on Amazon in the U.S. are rising faster than inflation.That’s according to a study done for Reuters by analytics firm DataWeave.It shows that the median price for a basket of such goods rose 2.6% between January and mid-June.Over roughly the same period, the core consumer prices index rose at an annualized rate of about 2%.DataWeave focused on 1,407 items sold on Amazon, where China is clearly listed as the country of origin.Products rising in price at the fastest pace included school and office supplies, electronic items like printers, and home goods like furnishings and cookware.The increase naturally varied from product to product, with some even seeing decreases.While other factors could be at play, DataWeave says the timing of the increases suggest a ripple effect from new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.Its analysis comes after numerous U.S. retailers warned of price hikes as a result of the trade war.That includes Walmart and department store chain Macy’s, as well as sportswear giant Nike.However, Amazon said it had not detected any big increase in average prices over the period of the study.Boss Andy Jassy said in May that the firm was “maniacally focused” on avoiding increases.Earlier in the year,  the U.S. hit Chinese goods with tariffs of 145%, though the new levies have since been rolled back to 30%.Donald Trump has defended the move as necessary to rebalance global trade.",
