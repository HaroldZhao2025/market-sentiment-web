And when you think that that's a $1 trillion market in North American home renovation, we think that under some scenarios, that could continue to grow another 5% or 6%.\" \"On the everyday side of the spectrum, one thing that came out of our work is coffee. So it turns out when you get older, you drink more coffee,\" Thomas explains, connecting this experience with the reason why coffee chain Dutch Bros. (BROS) is among TD Cowen's \"best ideas for 2025.
