The Sonnet 4.5 model created a web app from scratch in internal tests, and one customer had the AI chatbot code autonomously for 30 hours, up from a seven-hour run achieved by Anthropic's earlier Claude Opus 4 for a different client, Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger said.

      "summary": "(Reuters) -Anthropic unveiled the Claude 4.5 AI model on Monday, saying the newest version can code for longer uninterrupted stretches and handle finance and scientific tasks better, as the startup pushes deeper into enterprise AI.  The Sonnet 4.5 model created a web app from scratch in internal tests, and one customer had the AI chatbot code autonomously for 30 hours, up from a seven-hour run achieved by Anthropic's earlier Claude Opus 4 for a different client, Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger said.  Claude 4.5 is stronger at finance and scientific reasoning and better at using computers, scoring about 60% on a benchmark that tests operating-system dexterity versus roughly 40% for prior models, the company said.",
