Slowinski says the software sector has made a \"180-degree turn\" in the last six months of 2024, with a \"turn in sentiment\" that \"AI agents are finally the killer app that allows companies to monetize Gen AI.\" Among the software players, Slowinski names Salesforce (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) as stocks still trading at \"reasonable\" valuations that are positioned to gain from the adoptions of AI agents and copilots. On the other hand, Adobe (ADBE) is one he has worries about. \"Part of our concern around Adobe is just the increasing competition from the hyperscalers,\" like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT).

Holiday shoppers largely browsed at brick-and-mortar stores, making more online purchases at some retailers, snapping up such items as pre-owned Rolex watches, Pokemon cards and singer Sabrina Carpenter's perfumes at Walmart, and Fire TV streaming devices and Shark vacuums at Amazon during the deal-heavy week, which at Amazon began on Nov. 21, according to company statements.",
