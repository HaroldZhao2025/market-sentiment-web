    "summary": "Tech CEOs and executives are increasingly showing support for President-elect Donald Trump's second term. Notable figures include Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, and SoftBank (9434.T, 9984.T) CEO Masayoshi Son. The Verge senior policy reporter Lauren Feiner joined Catalysts to discuss this shift in attitude compared to Trump's first term. \"I think tech CEOs are taking a very different approach this time around when it comes to the Trump administration,\" Feiner noted, highlighting \"a lot less resistance\" and more \"openness\" to working with the president-elect. \"We're seeing a recognition from the tech industry that there's a lot on the line in terms of policies and lawsuits and they want to be on the right side of the administration going into things,\" she told Yahoo Finance. Regarding AI initiatives, Feiner believes the landscape will be more favorable under Trump, particularly with tech billionaire Elon Musk taking a vocal stance in the administration. However, she cautioned that the broader tech industry's sentiment remains uncertain, describing Musk's involvement as \"a big wildcard.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
