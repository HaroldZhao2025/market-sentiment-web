    "summary": "SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's state-owned internet network hired Amazon's untested startup satellite service to link people who cannot access its terrestrial network, rather than tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's Starlink.  The deal, whose financial terms were not disclosed, is set to provide high-speed internet access to some 300,000 homes and businesses that NBN Co's terrestrial network does not reach.  From next year, low-Earth orbit satellites owned by Amazon's Project Kuiper will start replacing two Australian government-owned satellites due for decommissioning in 2032, NBN and Amazon said in a joint statement on Tuesday.",
