    "summary": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -The head of an association representing global oilfield service firms in Mexico said on Thursday that a new business plan for state oil company Pemex lacks concrete measures to address its massive debt with suppliers, despite official promises to speed up payments.  Rafael Espino, president of the AMESPAC association, told Reuters that in a Tuesday meeting with officials from the finance and energy ministries and Pemex, there was no mention of how the company would pay down debts for work already performed in 2024 and the first half of 2025.  As of the end of June, Espino said, AMESPAC members were owed about 65 billion pesos ($3.49 billion) for work that has not yet even been invoiced.",
