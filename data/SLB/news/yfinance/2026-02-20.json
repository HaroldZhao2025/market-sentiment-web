    "summary": "President Donald Trump has set the stage for a possible military strike on Iran, presumably to pressure the country to meet demands for a nuclear deal.  The resulting tension between the U.S and Iran sent oil prices near six-month highs  and boosted some oil and gas stocks Thursday.  U.S. oil prices traded less than 1% lower Friday, holding above $66 per barrel.",
