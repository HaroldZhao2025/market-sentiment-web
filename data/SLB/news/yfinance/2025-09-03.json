    "summary": "Oil stocks slid Wednesday following a report that said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, or OPEC+, was weighing a boost to oil production.  The organization could begin to unwind a second layer of output cuts of about 1.65 million barrels per day more than a year ahead of schedule, Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.  This figure represents about 1.6% of world demand.",
