    "summary": "(Reuters) -Top-rated U.S. companies have financed their acquisitions mostly with equity and cash instead of debt this year, and could continue doing so even as M&A activity and hopes of interest rate cuts rise, bankers and investors said.  High debt costs and worries of credit-rating downgrades for taking on debt made funding acquisitions with cash and stock with sky-high valuations more compelling, they said.  Such cash-and-stock deals have become popular due to a narrowing gap between the pre-tax costs of equity and debt, according to Piers Ronan, co-head of debt capital markets at Atlanta-based investment bank Truist Securities.",
