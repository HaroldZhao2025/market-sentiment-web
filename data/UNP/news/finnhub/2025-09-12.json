    "headline": "Trump, Union Pacific CEO Discussed $72 Billion Acquisition of Norfolk Southern",
    "summary": "During a meeting in the Oval Office, Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena and the president “discussed how creating an American transcontinental railroad is a win for US competition, consumers and the unionized workers whose jobs will be protected when the merger is approved,” the company said in a statement.  The conversation highlights how Union Pacific is engaged at the highest levels of government as it works to create a coast-to-coast freight rail behemoth and capture freight volume from the trucking industry.  If Trump was among those signaling support to Vena, it would be a major sign of optimism for the merger, and a signal of the administration’s appetite for large-scale consolidation in contrast to the tough stance held by regulators under President Joe Biden.",
