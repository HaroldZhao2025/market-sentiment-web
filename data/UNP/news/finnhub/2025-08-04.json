    "summary": "LONDON (Reuters) -Global dealmaking has reached $2.6 trillion, the highest for the first seven months of the year since the 2021 pandemic-era peak, as a quest for growth in corporate boardrooms and the impact of a surge in AI activity has overcome the uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs.  The number of transactions to August 1 is 16% lower than the same time last year, but their value is 28% higher, according to Dealogic data, boosted by U.S. megadeals valued at more than $10 billion.  They include Union Pacific Corp's proposed $85 billion acquisition of small rival Norfolk Southern and OpenAI's $40 billion funding round led by Softbank Group.",
