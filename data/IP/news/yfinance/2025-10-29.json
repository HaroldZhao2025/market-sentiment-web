    "summary": "Shares of Smurfit Westrock tumbled 12% Wednesday after the paper-packaging firm reduced its 2025 profit forecast and said it would take down time at its facilities because of weak packaging demand.  The box maker's warnings are the latest sign pointing to declining cardboard demand, which in turn suggests slowing a slowing economy.  Demand for cardboard boxes has become a popular way to forecast economic growth and consumer spending, given that everything from fruits and vegetables to factory parts gets shipped in corrugated packaging.",
