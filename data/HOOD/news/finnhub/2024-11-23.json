    "summary": "The price of XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) has blasted over 122% higher (as of Nov. 19) since election night, vastly outperforming the likes of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency.  The sector has gone higher as well, as President-elect Donald Trump has positioned himself as a friend to the crypto industry and vowed to make changes favoring the industry and bringing the crypto spotlight back on the U.S.  While I think the sector can continue to perform well with a more friendly regulatory environment and lower interest rates, XRP is poised to outperform.",
