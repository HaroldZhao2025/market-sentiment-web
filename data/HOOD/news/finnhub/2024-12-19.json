    "summary": "Yahoo Finance has named Robinhood Markets (HOOD) its comeback stock of the year. The trading platform's shares have surged over 190% as the company achieved profitability and expanded its product offerings. Piper Sandler Companies senior research analyst Patrick Moley joins Market Domination to analyze Robinhood's growth trajectory. \"The most exciting part of this growth story is ahead of us,\" Moley states, highlighting the company's success in attracting customers and enhancing its product lineup. He points to Robinhood's new web-based trading platform, which opens access to 50% of the retail market that \"they never really had access to before,\" positioning the company for continued expansion in 2025. Moley notes that 75% of Robinhood's customer base consists of millennials or younger users, making products like cryptocurrency and mobile trading particularly appealing because \"the customers are much more open to trying new products if introduced on the platform.\" \"One in 10 Americans have a Robinhood account, yet they only have a quarter percent of ... the total retail assets in the United States,\" he explains, adding, \"It's a very small market share, but they have a very strong brand and we expect them to grow their assets under custody and grow earnings significantly in the coming year.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.
