The fall in the cryptocurrency and stocks such as Strategy and Coinbase Global comes as markets react to a hawkish shift in Federal Reserve policymaker comments raising doubt about an interest-rate cut next month, despite labor market softness.  Bitcoin's sell-off appears to have added another worry for stock market investors amid concern that financial engineering had begun to propel the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, including Magnificent Seven stocks like Nvidia.",
