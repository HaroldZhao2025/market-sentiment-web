Robinhood's stock plummeted as rising interest rates curbed the market's appetite for the higher-risk stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies that have driven most of its growth during the pandemic.  Robinhood's stock trades at about $36 as of this writing, which marks a five-bagger gain from its all-time low but still falls shy of its IPO price.",
