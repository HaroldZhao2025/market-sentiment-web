Factors such as elevated natural catastrophe losses, social inflationary concerns and climate change have led to sustainable profit margins, enhanced profitability and stronger financial positions, improving overall market stability and resilience for reinsurers such as Everest.  However, over the past year, hurricanes, wildfires and other large-scale U.S. natural disasters have weighed on earnings for P&C insurers, including Everest, which is considered one of the world's largest P&C reinsurers.",
