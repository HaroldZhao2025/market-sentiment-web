Increasing vehicle complexity and rising labor costs have led customers to favor totaling vehicles over repairing them. Improving acquisition costs for the vehicles sold by the company, which also offers remarketing services for selling damaged and total-loss vehicles, have also significantly driven down Copart's expenses.",
