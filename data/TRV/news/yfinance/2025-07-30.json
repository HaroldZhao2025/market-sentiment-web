Property and casualty insurers benefited during the quarter as individuals and businesses continued spending on insurance policies amid macroeconomic uncertainty and concerns over severe weather-related catastrophes. Underwriting income in Allstate's property-liability segment jumped to $1.28 billion in the second quarter, up from a loss of $145 million in the year-ago period.",
