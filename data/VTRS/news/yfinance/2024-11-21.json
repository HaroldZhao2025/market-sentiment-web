    "summary": "U.S. pharmaceutical giant Viatris Inc has been fined 7.58 million dirhams ($760,000) by Morocco's competition regulator for failing to notify it regarding its merger, two official sources said on Thursday.  Viatris was formed by the merger of Mylan, which has a subsidiary in Morocco, and Pfizer's Upjohn business in 2020.  The fine, equivalent to 2.5% Viatris' revenue in Morocco last year, has already been paid to the Moroccan treasury, the sources said, requesting anonymity.",
