    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bankrupt genetic testing company 23andMe told a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Wednesday that it wants to re-open bidding on its assets, including customers' genetic data, after receiving a $305 million offer from its co-founder Anne Wojcicki.  23andMe had previously selected a $256 million bid from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  as the lead offer after a bankruptcy auction concluded in May.  But it received a later bid from TTAM Research Institute, a new nonprofit founded by Wojcicki, and asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brian Walsh in St. Louis, Missouri, to be allowed to re-engage with potential buyers after determining that TTAM had sufficient financing to proceed with the higher offer.",
