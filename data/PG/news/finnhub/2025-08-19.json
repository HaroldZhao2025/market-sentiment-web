Still, analysts say this environment is a sweet spot for Walmart, which reports second-quarter results on Thursday before markets open.  The world's largest retailer by sales has surpassed earnings estimates for 11 consecutive quarters, according to LSEG data, sending its valuation soaring even as other consumer staples companies have struggled this year.",
