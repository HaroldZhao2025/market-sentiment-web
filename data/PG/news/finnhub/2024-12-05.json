    "summary": "Procter & Gamble has overhauled its supply chain for the tiny, extra-thin strips of stainless steel in its Gillette razors to source from India, a move expected to help protect its margins from any tariffs U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump may impose.  The stainless steel the Gillette-brand razor maker uses is highly specialized to prevent nicks and cuts and is only produced in large quantities by a handful of companies, none of which are located in the U.S., P&G has told the U.S. Commerce Department in public filings.  A Reuters analysis of import records over the past four years shows that P&G has shifted where it buys the stainless steel for its top grooming brands in the United States, its biggest market, to a cheaper Indian manufacturer, a move that may help it offset higher costs in Trump's second term.",
