    "summary": "Amid rising trade tensions stemming from President Trump's recent tariff proposals, consumers face the prospect of higher prices on household goods and personal care products. Barclays Managing Director and US Cosmetics, Household & Personal Care analyst Lauren Lieberman joins Market Domination to share insights on how consumer-facing companies are preparing for this economic uncertainty. She notes that while consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble (PG) have adapted by localizing supply chains, others like Colgate-Palmolive (CL) still rely on global networks. \"We've been really cautious and valuation has been the number one driver of that,\" Lieberman says, leading her to take a cautious stance on large-cap home and personal care (HPC) stocks. Additionally, Lieberman discusses consumer fatigue with price hikes and observes that \"volumes are pretty resilient\" while demand holds steady despite inflation. \"I think the realities of inflation in the grocery store, the... mass market in these categories, has been fairly slow to show through,\" she states.
