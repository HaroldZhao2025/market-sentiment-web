    "summary": "(Reuters) -U.S. medtech stocks fell on Thursday after the U.S. Commerce Department opened a probe into imports of medical devices, pressuring shares across the sector.  Analysts said the investigation may weigh on companies with globally sourced supply chains and create a modest overhang for the stocks.  Companies like GE HealthCare, Becton Dickinson, Stryker, Insulet, Intuitive Surgical and ResMed were among the worst performers on the S&P Health Care Equipment index, down between 4% and 11%.",
