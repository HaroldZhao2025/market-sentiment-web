    "summary": "(Reuters) -Synlait Milk reported a much narrower annual net loss on Monday and announced the sale of its North Island assets for NZ$307 million ($177.2 million) to U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories, sending its shares surging.  The dairy producer said in a statement that strong customer demand and new product development in the Advanced Nutrition business segment delivered a NZ$21.1 million underlying gross margin increase, while a turnaround from last fiscal year's poor Ingredients business performance also helped the bottom line.  The company announced the divestiture of its North Island assets to healthcare firm Abbott, which is expected to strengthen Synlait’s financial position by significantly reducing debt.",
