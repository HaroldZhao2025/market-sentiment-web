Klarna has “a particularly strong franchise in Europe, where we believe Klarna is a new, emerging closed loop payment scheme, similar to  American Express  in the United States,” the analysts wrote.  The nod to AmEx, one of the largest credit-card providers in the U.S., parallels commentary from members of management, who told Barron’s ahead of the IPO that the company was aiming to challenge the traditional banking sector.",
