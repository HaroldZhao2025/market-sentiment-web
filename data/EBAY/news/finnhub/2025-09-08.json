You may not be able to guess this tech icon going through a rebirth, but here are a few clues. Yahoo Finance data shows this company’s stock trading on a forward P/E ratio of 15.9 times. That’s a discount to the S&P 500’s 22 times multiple. Second, the company went public on September 24, 1998. So we are coming up on a public company birthday of sorts. And lastly, it has seen 10 straight quarters of double-digit sales gains in its collectibles business — powered by demand for sports cards and Pokémon cards. You are not getting this so that we will give you the company: eBay (EBAY)! We have been pleasantly surprised by the company’s financial results this year. Margins have improved, and sources tell me the business is moving beyond an inflection point. So is it time to play this old tech name into year-end? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with eBay CEO Jamie Iannone about the company’s reinvention and what’s next!
