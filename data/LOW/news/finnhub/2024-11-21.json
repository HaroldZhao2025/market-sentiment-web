    "headline": "Walmart wins, Target misses in mixed retail earnings report",
    "summary": "Big box retailers reported mixed earnings this week, with Walmart (WMT) exceeding expectations, driven by higher-income consumers, while Target (TGT) experienced its largest earnings miss in two years. HSBC senior Americas retail analyst Daniela Bretthauer joins Catalysts Co-hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to break down the results, noting that weaker-than-expected results and soft guidance for fiscal year 2025 left Target behind. “At the end of the day, you need to deliver and we saw that from Walmart, and we didn't see that from Target,” Bretthauer said.
