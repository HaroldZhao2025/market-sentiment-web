    "summary": "As the U.S. Federal Reserve restarts interest rate cuts, housing shares are one of the areas of the stock market that may benefit, and they have perked up in recent weeks as markets priced in more monetary easing.  On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank lowered its benchmark rate for the first time since December and indicated more cuts would follow as it tries to shore up a shaky labor market.  The Fed's move stands to help interest-rate sensitive areas such as small-cap and consumer discretionary shares.",
