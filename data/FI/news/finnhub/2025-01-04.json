But what I find incredibly interesting about it is it performed really, really well in 2024, and almost no one wants to talk about it.\" \"I think a lot of people got burned when the fintech bubble kind of popped post-pandemic, but there's a lot of stocks within this group, like PayPal (PYPL), Fiserv (FI), that have really good business models that are at scale, that are pretty reasonably priced,\" he says.
