Most natural gas producers have been content with eking out a profit on the $3 payout—but one company is now making a bold play to sell gas directly to Europe and Asia, adding new risks but potentially supersizing its returns.  Pittsburgh-based  EQT  one of the dominant producers in the Appalachian Basin, has signed three contracts over the past three weeks to buy liquefied natural gas from export terminals in Texas and Louisiana.",
