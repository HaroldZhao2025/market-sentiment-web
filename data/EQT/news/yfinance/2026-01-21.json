    "summary": "A storm will descend on the US starting Friday, plunging Texas into a deep freeze before threatening to dump snow on New York City and Boston.  The conditions bring the threat of disruptions to gas production as water freezes inside pipelines — a situation that proved disastrous for Texas in 2021, when gas supply outages during extreme cold contributed to a collapse of the state’s power grid.  “This is shaping up to be the most impactful storm of the winter so far,” said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc.",
