According to data compiled by LSEG, funds tracking equities in Latin America and emerging Europe have each gained around 24% so far this year, while broader emerging market equity funds are up 9.3%.  Notably, equity funds focused on Morocco, Colombia, Greece, Brazil, and Portugal have each returned more than 30% this year.",
