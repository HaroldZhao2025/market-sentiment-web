    "summary": "Russian stocks are likely to need more time to reenter the widely followed MSCI global equity indexes that the most optimistic scenario of two years from June, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a client note.  Russia was removed from the MSCI equity indexes, including its emerging markets benchmark, in early March 2022, days after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine began.  In a late Tuesday note, JPMorgan said that while investors hoping for an imminent resolution to the war might be expecting the two-year process for stocks to rejoin the index to start in June, it was \"too optimistic\" to think that timeline would be met.",
