    "summary": "TCW senior portfolio manager Eli Horton joined Market Domination Overtime to discuss how the upcoming Trump administration could reshape the power and energy sector. \"The Republican administration should be favorable for energy transformation,\" Horton said, emphasizing that this remains \"a decades-long journey\" requiring substantial capital investment. He highlighted the critical need to invest in \"brown companies\" during the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, noting that the current market is strategically positioned for this shift. \"We need more reliable power in this country; we can't do it all with wind and solar,\" he told Yahoo Finance, advocating for traditional energy sources like natural gas, which the Trump administration supports. Horton expressed a preference for brown energy companies over green alternatives, specifically pointing to stocks like GE Vernova (GEV) as potential investment opportunities. Watch the video above to hear how Horton believes emerging technologies like AI will impact growth in the energy space.
