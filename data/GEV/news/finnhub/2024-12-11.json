    "headline": "GE Vernova is focused on sustainability with AI hyperscalers: CEO",
    "summary": "After spinning off from General Electric in April 2024, GE Vernova (GEV) announced its first dividend alongside a $6 billion share buyback program at its latest investor day. GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik sits down with Market Domination's Julie Hyman to expand upon the energy producer's timeline for expansion across its segments. \"A lot more demand will happen in the US throughout the rest of the decade, and then that install base is going to continue to run,\" Strazik explains. \"You think about the US, and between 40 to 45% of our electricity comes from gas power today, and we're about to go into a real load cycle. In the rest of the world, that number is closer to 25%, but as other parts of the world shift like the US has shifted with things like coal to gas, the proportion of gas electricity will only grow.\" While Big Tech begins investing heavily in energy infrastructure and even nuclear small modular reactors (SMR) to power its AI data centers, Strazik finds that \"the focus on sustainability ultimately hasn't changed at all\" and has been working with these hyperscalers to decarbonize. The chief executive comments that GE Vernova has 65 nuclear plants operating in the US currently using the company's technology.
