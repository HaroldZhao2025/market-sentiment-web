      "summary": "Many vendors are engaging in \"agent washing\" - the rebranding of products such as AI assistants and chatbots without significant agentic capabilities, Gartner says, estimating that only about 130 of the thousands of agentic AI vendors are real.  \"Most agentic AI projects right now are early stage experiments or proofs of concept that are mostly driven by hype and are often misapplied,\" said Anushree Verma, Senior Director Analyst at Gartner.  Gartner predicts at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be made autonomously through agentic AI by 2028, up from 0% in 2024.",
