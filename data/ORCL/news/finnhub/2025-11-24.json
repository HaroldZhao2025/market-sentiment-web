      "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -A rush of bond sales by major tech firms to fund artificial intelligence expansion is creating a high-stakes bet for the $9 trillion U.S. corporate ​bond market, prompting caution from prominent investors like DoubleLine over the sector's growing debt load.

High-grade bond markets may need to absorb $1.5 trillion of AI data center bond sales over the next five years, with that type of debt potentially representing ⁠over 20% of the investment-grade ‌bond market by 2030, J.P. Morgan analysts estimated recently.",
