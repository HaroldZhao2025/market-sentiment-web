    "summary": "Oracle was sued on Wednesday by bondholders who say they suffered losses because the company ​chaired by billionaire Larry Ellison concealed its need to sell significant ‌additional debt to build out its artificial intelligence infrastructure.  The proposed class action was filed in a ‌New York state court in Manhattan on behalf of investors who said they bought $18 billion of senior notes and bonds that Oracle issued on September 25, shortly after the software and cloud computing company signed a $300 billion, five-year contract to supply ⁠Sam Altman's OpenAI with computing ‌power.  \"The bond market's reaction to Oracle's additional debt was swift and bracing,\" the bondholders said, ​as their own debt fell in value and began trading at yields ‌and spreads comparable to debt from lower-rated companies because of the perceived higher credit risk.",

Over the course of 12 videos, the two will share their thoughts on everything from the memory explosion to software stocks to robotics. In this video, Eric takes a deeper look at the rise of AI factories, massive data centers with a capacity of more than 1 gigawatt. As Eric notes, it's not just Oracle's Stargate getting into the race. There are also new super factories from Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and many others. Companies with data center cooling portfolios like Vertiv (NYSE: VRT), nVent Electric (NYSE: NVT), Modine Manufacturing (NYSE: MOD) could be winners as the construction of this new generation of data centers takes off.",
