        "summary": "TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, on Thursday said it has finalized a deal to establish a majority American-owned joint venture that will secure U.S. data, to avoid a U.S. ban on the short video app ​used by over 200 million Americans.  The deal is a milestone for the social media firm after years of battles that began ‌in August 2020 when President Donald Trump tried to ban the app over national security concerns.  Trump later opted not to enforce a law passed in April 2024 requiring ByteDance to ‌sell its U.S. assets by the following January or face a ban - a measure upheld by the Supreme Court.",
