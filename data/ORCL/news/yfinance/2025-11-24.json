Since the start of September, so-called AI hyperscalers  Amazon  com,  Alphabet Meta Platforms  and  Oracle  have issued nearly $90 billion of investment-grade bonds, according to Dealogic, more than they had sold over the previous 40 months.  AI data-center developers like  TeraWulf  and  Cipher Mining  both started as bitcoin miners, also have stormed the speculative-grade market, issuing more than $7 billion of those lower-rated bonds.",
