    "summary": "Alphabet is taking on OpenAI with a gusto that underscores Wall Street's perception that the Google parent is the leader in AI, a turn of events from a year ago when investors thought it was badly lagging behind rivals and punished its ​stock.  Alphabet executives struck a more confident tone on the company's post-earnings call on Wednesday, the first since it released the Gemini 3 model, which has wowed users and ‌helped Google catch up in the artificial intelligence race.  Though it did not mention its chief AI rival by name, Alphabet's newly confident messaging emphasized a key contrast: Investments in AI have begun to reap returns throughout the entire company.",
