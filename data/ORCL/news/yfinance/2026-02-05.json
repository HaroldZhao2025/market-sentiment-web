Alphabet executives struck a more confident tone on the company's post-earnings call on Wednesday, the first since it released the Gemini 3 model, which has wowed users and ‌helped Google catch up in the artificial intelligence race.  Though it did not mention its chief AI rival by name, Alphabet's newly confident messaging emphasized a key contrast: Investments in AI have begun to reap returns throughout the entire company.",
