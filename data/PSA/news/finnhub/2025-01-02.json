The firm is “cautiously positive” on the self storage sector into 2025. It expects initial outlooks will be conservative, so Jefferies believes “there is no rush to buy ahead of the quarter.” However, any recovery in the housing market in 2025 will be met by renewed storage demand and upward revisions to guidance and estimates, the analyst tells investors in a research note.",
