    "summary": "(Reuters) -Corporate travel and expense company Navan said on Friday it is targeting a valuation of up to $6.45 billion in its U.S. initial public offering, below the level it reached in a 2022 funding round, as it pushes ahead with listing plans despite the U.S. government shutdown.  The offering comes amid a rebound in U.S. IPO activity, driven by easing market volatility, which is lifting investor sentiment after a period of trade policy uncertainty.  The strong market debuts of Alliance Laundry and Phoenix Education Partners on Thursday underscored renewed appetite for risk among investors.",
