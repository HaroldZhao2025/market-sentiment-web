    "summary": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been selling stocks at a higher clip than usual this year.  Through the first three quarters of 2024, Berkshire sold $133 billion worth of stocks.  This mostly reflects recent sales of Berkshire's largest holding, Apple, but it also trimmed its Bank of America stake, which has also been a sizable investment for Berkshire in recent years.",
