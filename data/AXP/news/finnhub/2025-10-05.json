Then in June,  JPMorgan Chase  raised the annual cost on his Sapphire Reserve card by 45% to $795 and  American Express  teased something similar on his Platinum card.  The choice was clear: Get rid of the Platinum card before his annual fee goes up 29% to $895 next year and shift most of his estimated $8,000 to $10,000 in monthly spending to his Sapphire Reserve.",
