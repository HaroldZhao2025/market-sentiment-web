    "summary": "Opening Bid Unfiltered is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. What if your apartment worked like a five-star hotel? On this episode of Opening Bid Unfiltered, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with Bilt founder Ankur Jain to unpack how AI is reshaping life at home—from concierge-style maintenance to neighborhood rewards and seamless local commerce. Jain explains why Bilt is positioning itself as a customer experience platform, not a bank or credit card company, and why traditional players like American Express (AXP) and PayPal (PYPL) have missed this opportunity. The conversation offers a forward-looking look at how AI could redefine housing, loyalty, and everyday spending. Listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website for full episodes of Opening Bid Unfiltered. This post was written by Langston Sessoms, producer for Opening Bid Unfiltered.",
