    "summary": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned BNY that its reported interest in a merger with Northern Trust could violate federal banking laws, saying any potential deal between the two large custody banks raises antitrust concerns.  Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a longtime big bank critic, told BNY CEO Robin Vince in a letter sent Tuesday that such a deal, which would combine the world's largest custody bank with a major competitor, would pose major financial stability concerns, and asked for a briefing on the status of potential talks, as well as any ongoing discussions with regulators.  BNY declined to comment on the letter, and Northern Trust did not respond to a request for comment.",
