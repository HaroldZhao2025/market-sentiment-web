    "summary": "The U.S. government had filed a lawsuit against SCE in 2023, alleging negligence that caused the wildfire, which burned nearly 180 square miles (466.2 square kilometers) in one of the largest wildfires in Los Angeles County.  In a complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court, the government alleged that the wildfire began on September 6, 2020, when a poorly maintained tree contacted power lines, igniting vegetation on a branch, which then fell to the ground and spread the fire.  \"This record settlement against Southern California Edison provides meaningful compensation to taxpayers for the extensive costs of fighting the Bobcat Fire and for the widespread damage to public lands,\" said United States Attorney Bill Essayli.",
