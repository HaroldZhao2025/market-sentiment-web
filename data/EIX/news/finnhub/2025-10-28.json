This comparison is not meaningful because during the quarter, SCE recorded a true-up for the 2025 general rate case final decision, which is retroactive to January 1.  Reflecting the year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, including the costs for potential early refinancing activities later this year, we are narrowing our 2025 core EPS guidance range to $5.95 to $6.20 and are reaffirming our 5% to 7% core EPS growth target.",
