    "summary": "TOKYO (Reuters) -Komatsu should see a nearly 20 billion yen ($140 million) mitigation in the impact of U.S. tariffs on its bottom line after the U.S.-China trade truce last week, the Japanese company's CEO said, suggesting its outlook for lower profits may not be as bad as feared.  With more than one-quarter of Komatsu's sales coming from North America, the reduction in the tariff impact - a roughly 20% easing in its forecast of a 94.3 billion yen hit from the tariffs - would have an outsized effect on its profit outlook.  In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Takuya Imayoshi, the head of the world's second-largest construction and mining machinery maker, did not say it is officially revising its forecast last month of a 27% drop in current-year profit as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
