    "summary": "A former Federal Reserve governor who retired in August listed several stock trades in her financial disclosure documents for 2024 that violated the central bank's ethics rules.  The transactions are outlined in a report released Saturday by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which reviewed Adriana Kugler's financial disclosures after the Fed referred them to its inspector general earlier this year.  Kugler, who unexpectedly stepped down from the Fed board Aug. 8, disclosed more than a dozen individual stock trades, including several made during financial trading “blackout periods” around the time the Federal Reserve's policymaking committee meets to set interest rates and other monetary policy.",
