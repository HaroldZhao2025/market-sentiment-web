    "summary": "A Wells Fargo analyst recently raised the company's price target for RTX (NYSE: RTX) stock to  $151 from a previous target of $140 and maintained an \"overweight\" rating on the stock.  As such, it represents a 31% premium to the current price, but is the new target warranted?  The Wall Street consensus has RTX generating $8.4 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2026, which, based on the current market cap of $153 billion, would put RTX on a price-to-FCF multiple of 18.2 times 2026 FCF -- the Wells Fargo analyst makes a similar argument based on earnings.",
