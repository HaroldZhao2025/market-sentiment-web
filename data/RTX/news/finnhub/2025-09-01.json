    "summary": "LONDON (Reuters) -Wizz Air is working towards a deal with RTX-owned jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney to accelerate the servicing of its engines, delays with which have left large chunks of the European low-cost carrier's fleet grounded, its CEO told Reuters on Monday.  A defect in the powder metal used to make high-pressure turbines and compressor discs has impacted certain Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, disrupting airlines globally, especially those, like Wizz, flying Airbus A320neo-family jets.  If the previously unreported talks result in a deal, it could help Wizz get its fleet back up to full speed faster, boost investor confidence and lift the carrier's struggling share price.",
