Infrastructure projects are coming into sharper focus as cloud hyperscalers double down on their commitments to build data centers and buy high-performance chipsets.  One of these is the Stargate Project: Between now and 2029, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and OpenAI say they will invest a total of $500 billion into data centers and other digital infrastructure in the U.S. It's a plan that should have investors quite excited.",

    "summary": "You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. Wild movements in the bond market have been one of the biggest stories on Wall Street in 2025. In part, the climb in yields on US debt has reflected rising concerns about the country’s fiscal position. Those worries have now been compounded by a new Trump tax bill that promises to add trillions to the US’s already bloated deficit. While professionals say investors haven’t lost trust in the US’s ability to honor its debt, they will continue to demand higher yields to compensate for the rising risk. That could have major ramifications in markets for everything from the demand for Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock to housing. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast with BlackRock (BLK) Global Chief Investment Officer of Fixed Income Rick Rieder, one of the top minds in the bond market. Rieder reveals his latest thinking on fixed income as he manages $2.7 trillion in assets at BlackRock. Rieder also weighs in on the outlook for stocks in the face of what could be higher interest rates for longer from the Federal Reserve.
