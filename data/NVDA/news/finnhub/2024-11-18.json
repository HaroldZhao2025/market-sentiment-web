As the post-election rally searches for direction, what are some of the core themes becoming apparent in retail investor behavior? Investopedia Editor-In-Chief Caleb Silver sits down with Josh Lipton to expand upon the retail investor reaction to recent market moves and proposed policies by President-elect Donald Trump, finding ETFs and crypto to very much be on retail investors' radars. \"We asked them that question very specifically, what of the policies that the Trump administration has promised, Do you think will be the most beneficial or the most hurtful to your portfolio? Obviously, the ones that would be the most hurtful are the ones you think of tariffs,\" Silver says. \"But when you ask them on the flip side, what about taxes?

Meeks points out that while Nvidia has continued to outperform expectations each quarter, the earnings beats have been decreasing in recent quarters. \"A lot is expected of Nvidia, and they're gonna have to beat the estimates by even more. Let's get back to a double-digit percentage increase beat, and then I think people will feel more comfortable,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. Despite this, he doesn't see demand slowing at the company, stating, \"Nobody else is as close as they are to making these chips.\" Regarding competition, Meeks foresees Nvidia continuing to be a frontrunner in the space. However, he does point to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), believing the company can \"get its act together and be a viable second source.\" However, when it comes to overall market share, Meeks states, \"Nvidia will continue to have the biggest slice of that pie.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

      "summary": "Global stocks began the week on firmer footing ahead of a highly anticipated earnings release from Nvidia, while in Japan, a speech from its central bank's head left markets none the wiser on the country's rate outlook.  Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated on Monday the central bank will keep raising interest rates if economic and price developments move in line with its forecasts, but made no mention of whether a hike could come in December.  His speech had been closely watched by investors for clues on the BOJ's next rate hike, which could have been seen as a way to push back against the yen's weakness.",
