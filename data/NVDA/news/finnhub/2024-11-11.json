This sentiment is fueled by Trump's pro-crypto stance, the prospect of reduced regulation, and the backing of influential tech CEO Elon Musk. Frontier Foundry Co-Founder and CEO Sultan Meghji joins Catalysts to share his outlook on this emerging trend. \"Even if we just go back to something that looks like a Trump 1.0, and I actually think they'll go farther than that, it'll still be quite a big swing,\" he states, anticipating significant deregulatory measures across the federal bureaucracy that will further energize the AI and crypto markets. Meghji believes that this time around, the Trump administration will view these transformative technologies as \"growth measures for the economy versus things to be managed.\" He notes that AI and crypto are \"fundamentally things that should be built and sold out of the United States both for our own use here and globally,\" presenting a \"huge opportunity\" that the president-eleft understands. However, Meghji expresses concern over Trump's mass deportation plans, calling them \"a huge issue.\" While acknowledging the desire to attract the \"best and the brightest\" talent, he also points out that immigrants have faced challenges finding open jobs in the US.

However, Sherwood Senior Correspondent Ronnie Molla suggests this public show of support was more calculated than genuine. \"It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,\" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of \"hold[ing] a grudge\" or being \"very vindictive.\" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they \"stand to gain\" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains \"so uncertain\" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.
