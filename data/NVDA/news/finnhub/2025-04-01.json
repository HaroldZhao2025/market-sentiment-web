Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer assessed the Blackwell manufacturing timeline on Tuesday.  The analyst wrote that checks on Nvidia’s supply chains in Asia suggest production is in “full swing” and that the company probably will ship from 30,000 to 50,000 of its NV72 liquid-cooled rack systems, with dozens of graphics-processing units networked together, this year.",
