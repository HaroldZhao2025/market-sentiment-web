      "summary": "STORY: Nvidia is reportedly requiring full upfront payment from Chinese customers seeking its H200 AI chips.Two sources told Reuters it's due to ongoing uncertainty over Beijing's approval of the shipments.They said the U.S. chipmaker has imposed unusually strict terms.Including full payment for orders with no options to cancel, ask for refunds or change configurations after placement.Nvidia and China’s industry ministry have yet to respond to requests for comment.Last month, Reuters reported Chinese tech firms have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips, priced at around $27,000 each.That exceeds Nvidia's inventory of 700,000 of the chips.While Chinese chipmakers have developed AI processors, their performance still lags behind Nvidia's H200 for large-scale training of advanced AI models.Bloomberg reported Thursday that China plans to approve some H200 imports as soon as this quarter.The report said Chinese officials are preparing to allow purchases for select commercial uses.But will still ban purchases by the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure and state-owned enterprises due to security concerns.",
