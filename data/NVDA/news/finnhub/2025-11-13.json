Yahoo Finance hit the streets of New York to learn more about how everyday people are feeling about three of the year's most dominant themes: the economy, artificial intelligence (AI), and cryptocurrency. The economy: While markets have mostly rebounded from their April lows, many Americans say the economic pain hasn't eased. Between tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation to the lingering effects of the government shutdown, the outlook for 2026 remains murky. \"I know a lot of new grads who are having a really hard time getting jobs,\" said Katie, a sales rep at ReportPass. \"I think that's a good sign of the economy ... going down.\" AI's rapid rise: AI has officially gone mainstream, and it's not slowing down anytime soon. For example, Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a $1 billion partnership with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) to build next-generation data centers, while OpenAI struck a deal with Amazon (AMZN), gaining access to AWS infrastructure and Nvidia's cutting-edge AI technology. As the technology races ahead, New Yorkers are asking: Should we embrace it fully, or start pumping the brakes? Crypto's comeback:Crypto saw major growth in 2025; for example, bitcoin (BTC-USD), ethereum (ETH-USD), and XRP (XRP-USD) hit all-time highs this year before more recently pulling back. However, despite this surge, skepticism remains. Some New Yorkers told Yahoo Finance they still question crypto's staying power and whether it's truly ready for everyday use.
