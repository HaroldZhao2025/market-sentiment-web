Ahead of the earnings release, the Trump administration released an order for US suppliers to halt shipments of AI chip software to China.

Rhodium Group Director Reva Goujon comes on Yahoo Finance's Nvidia earnings special to speak further on the United States' export controls on AI semiconductors and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's relationship with President Trump.

      "summary": "Nvidia (NVDA) released its highly anticipated first quarter earnings report after Wednesday's closing bell, rounding out the Magnificent Seven's earnings season. Ahead of the earnings release, the Trump administration released an order for US suppliers to halt shipments of AI chip software to China. The chip stock continues to get a lift in extended hours trading after beating first quarter revenue estimates — $44.1 billion vs. estimates of $43.3 billion — while bans on chip shipments to China dragged down the company's earnings per share to $0.81 (below estimates of $0.93 per share). Rhodium Group Director Reva Goujon comes on Yahoo Finance's Nvidia earnings special to speak further on the United States' export controls on AI semiconductors and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's relationship with President Trump. Also catch Benchmark Company's Cody Acree full interview with Yahoo Finance on Nvidia's business in China and whether it can overcome new trade barriers. Stay tuned for Yahoo Finance's special live coverage of Nvidia's first quarter earnings here, beginning at 4:15 p.m. on Wednesday, May 28.",
