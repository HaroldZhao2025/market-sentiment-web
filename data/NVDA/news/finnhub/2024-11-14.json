Kerwin believes these companies may seek to diversify their trade relationships to regions like India or Southeast Asia, stating \"it will be a trend across the sector.\" However, he cautions that high China exposure does not necessarily equate to high investment risk, saying, \"You really have to unpack what's in that exposure.\" Regarding regulatory impacts, Kerwin thinks \"there could still be some antitrust [action] against the largest of tech companies.\" But he also expects \"M&A deals at the rung just below those largest of largest tech companies can start to pick up again over the next four years.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.
