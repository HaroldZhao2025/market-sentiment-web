The Magnificent 7 stocks are performing strongly again, even with chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report not due until May 28. This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

The US and China have agreed to ratchet down the tariff war for 90 days as each economy begins to feel the pressure of bruising penalties. After a weekend of meetings in Switzerland, the US will take reciprocal tariffs on China down to 10% from 125%. A separate tariff imposed by President Trump over what he says is China’s role in the fentanyl trade will stay intact. China will cut its retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%. Stocks soared on the news, the US dollar caught a strong bid, and defensive plays such as gold sold off. Investors will now be looking for two things to keep the bullish vibes going: first, that the two economic superpowers signal there is an opportunity to take tariffs down even further after the 90-day pause; and second, that the tariffs aren’t hammering the US economy.
