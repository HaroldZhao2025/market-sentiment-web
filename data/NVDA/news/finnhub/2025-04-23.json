    "summary": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) tumbled after the company revealed that it will incur a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter related to its H2O graphics processing units (GPUs) due to new export restrictions on the sale of its chips to countries like China.  Nvidia's stock has had a tough start to 2025, with its share price down about 25% as of this writing.  A dumbed-down version of its H100 and H200 GPUs, Nvidia's H20 chip was designed specifically to sell into the Chinese market to meet prior export control restrictions.",

    "summary": "Nvidia has turned out to be one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past decade, as the company has delivered phenomenal gains of more than 19,700% during this period and bested the S&P 500 index's gains of 156% by a massive margin.  What this means is that an investment of $5,100 made in Nvidia a decade ago is now worth just over a million dollars.  Investors who had the foresight to put this much money into Nvidia 10 years ago and had the patience to hold the stock for such a long time are now sitting on handsome gains, becoming millionaires in the process.",
