    "headline": "AI: Why investors need to expand beyond Nvidia",
    "summary": "The artificial intelligence (AI) trade is expanding beyond semiconductors and into infrastructure, data centers, software, inference capabilities, and more. Global X assistant vice president and research analyst Tejas Dessai joins Market Domination to discuss the evolving AI landscape. \"Over the past couple of years, I think Big Tech has had significant evidence of success when it comes to artificial intelligence,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. Dessai notes that clear investment value continues to drive growth, benefiting semiconductor leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) and other chip and infrastructure companies. While investment concentration among major companies could eventually slow, Dessai believes this won't happen in 2025. He cites Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip, which promises improved efficiency and necessary computing power. \"AI infrastructure is maturing,\" he explains, predicting that current infrastructure investments will shift toward AI inference as use cases develop by 2030. Although Nvidia maintains market leadership, Dessai identifies Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell (MRVL) as potential market share gainers. \"Our advice to investors would be: If Nvidia has worked for you so far, great, but you need to zoom out and focus on the bigger AI infrastructure and data center landscape and really look to get some exposure to that dynamic,\" he states.
