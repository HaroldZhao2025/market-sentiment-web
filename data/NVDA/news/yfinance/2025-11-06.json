In this episode of Stocks in Translation, Hennion & Walsh Chief Investment Officer Kevin Mahn joins host Allie Canal and Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma to discuss whether or not the market is running off an AI bubble as companies like Nvidia and others continue to pour billions into the technology’s foundation. Mahn argues the real risk is not in overspending, it’s sitting out of the race entirely. He offers his insights as to why it’s important to get into the game before it’s too late. Check out the full episode here. Twice a week, Stocks In Translation cuts through the market mayhem, noisy numbers and hyperbole to give you the information you need to make the right trade for your portfolio.
