    "summary": "President Donald Trump’s decision to increase the level tariffs on U.S. imports, less than 24 hours after declaring his original schedule provided “great certainty” for the global economy, again has stoked concerns over trade policy and ignited another round of “Sell America” pressures in trading Monday.  Trump, who said Friday he would use an untested section of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a 10% tariff on goods from abroad after losing a Supreme Court ruling on his use of emergency powers, abruptly changed tack and increased the levy to 15% in a social media post published on Saturday.  The move left many U.S. trade partners, some of which are in the process of ratifying deals made last year in the wake of the sweeping levies the Supreme Court now ruled illegal, in limbo or seeking to cut new deals with Washington based on the new tariff schedule.",

        "description": "",
        "summary": "President Donald Trump’s decision to increase the level tariffs on U.S. imports, less than 24 hours after declaring his original schedule provided “great certainty” for the global economy, again has stoked concerns over trade policy and ignited another round of “Sell America” pressures in trading Monday.  Trump, who said Friday he would use an untested section of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a 10% tariff on goods from abroad after losing a Supreme Court ruling on his use of emergency powers, abruptly changed tack and increased the levy to 15% in a social media post published on Saturday.  The move left many U.S. trade partners, some of which are in the process of ratifying deals made last year in the wake of the sweeping levies the Supreme Court now ruled illegal, in limbo or seeking to cut new deals with Washington based on the new tariff schedule.",
