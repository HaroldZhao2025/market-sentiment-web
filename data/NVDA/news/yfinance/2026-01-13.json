        "summary": "Nvidia does not require upfront payment for H200 chips, a ​spokesperson for the U.S. chipmaker said in ‌a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.  The company said it \"would ‌never require customers to pay for products they do not receive\", in a response to a Reuters story on January 8 about the company ⁠having imposed unusually ‌stringent terms requiring full upfront payment from Chinese customers seeking its artificial intelligence ‍chips.  One source told Reuters that Nvidia's standard terms for Chinese clients have previously included advance payment requirements, ​but they were sometimes allowed to place ‌a deposit rather than make a full payment upfront.",
