    "headline": "Why AI agents are 'a massive opportunity' in 2025",
    "summary": "The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman shares insights on artificial intelligence (AI) agents' growing impact heading into 2025 on Market Domination. Newman projects that AI agents represent a $4 trillion annual global market opportunity over the next five years, describing it as \"a massive opportunity\" for companies. He explains that these AI solutions can provide organizations with thousands of \"people-like workers\" to handle automated tasks. \"Agentic use cases are being used to help drive productivity, but also ... to create more efficient economics for enterprises,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. According to Newman, AI agents are gaining traction because they enable companies to start \"unlocking the value of their enterprise data to create productivity growth.\" He predicts that \"we're going to see it embedded in every software stack.\" When discussing Big Tech's prospects under a new Trump administration, Newman expresses optimism: \"I think he's going to want to see these companies remain prosperous.\" He also anticipates increased merger-and-acquisition activity in the sector throughout the coming year.
