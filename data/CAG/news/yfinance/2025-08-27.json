    "summary": "Higher inflation has prompted packaged food companies such as J.M. Smucker and Conagra Brands to raise product prices in a bid to offset elevated input costs, which have worsened due to tariff-led expenses since the start of the year.  The rise in prices has led to weaker product demand for J.M. Smucker, whose shares fell about 7% following the results.  The company, which imports green coffee majorly from Brazil and Vietnam, had warned in June that the commodity's heavy exposure to tariffs would hurt its profitability.",
