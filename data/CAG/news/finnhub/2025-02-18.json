    "summary": "Market Domination Overtime hosts Julie Hyman and Alexandra Canal outline key events investors should monitor for Wednesday, February 19. On the earnings calendar, Wingstop (WING), Etsy (ETSY), and Conagra Brands (CAG) will report quarterly results before the market opens, while Carvana (CVNA) and Toast (TOST) will release their earnings reports later in the afternoon. Investors will closely analyze the minutes from the Federal Reserve's January FOMC meeting. These minutes, along with scheduled remarks from Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, should provide deeper insight into the central bank's monetary policy outlook. Additionally, new US housing starts and building permits data will be released. Economists anticipate January housing starts to reach 1.39 million and permits to hit 1.46 million, both figures showing declines from December levels.
