    "summary": "(Reuters) -President Donald Trump's antitrust enforcers recently cleared a string of multibillion-dollar deals in a week, demonstrating a willingness to settle with companies that marks a shift from the Biden administration.  The U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission cleared three deals that were together worth $63 billion in June, illustrating how FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson and DOJ antitrust head Gail Slater are taking a different tack from their predecessors.  The settlements, along with a return to formally cutting short waiting periods, provide certainty to dealmakers and could smooth the path for companies like Nutella maker Ferrero, which on Thursday entered a deal to pay $3.1 billion for cereal maker WK Kellogg.",
