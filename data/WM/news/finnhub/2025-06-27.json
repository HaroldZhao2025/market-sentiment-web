    "summary": "CIBC raised the firm’s price target on WM (WM) to $250 from $244 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The firm said its main takeaway from the company’s three-year outlook presented at its Investor Day is that it continues to expect outsized EBITDA and free cash flow growth, with this growth exceeding 2019-2021 targets from WM’s 2019 Investor Day. It appears the company is not suffering from the law of large numbers, which addresses a concern that the growth rate will slow relative to peers",
