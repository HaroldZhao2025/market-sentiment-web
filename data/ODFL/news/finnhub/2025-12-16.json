    "summary": "After nearly a year of President Donald Trump's trade-war policies, which upended international shipping, the Port of Los Angeles expects only a slight decline in import volumes in 2026 but warned that uncertainty remains.  In a media briefing Tuesday, Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka discussed the impact of Trump's tariffs on trade and the economy, calling 2025 a \"roller coaster\" and adding that port volumes are unlikely to fall \"off a cliff\" in 2026.  \"We'll probably see single-digit declines in overall volume on the import side compared to this year, mainly because you've still got some pretty high inventories throughout the nation,\" Seroka said of the 2026 outlook.",
