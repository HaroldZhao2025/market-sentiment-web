        "summary": "U.S. stocks are rising toward records Friday following a mixed report on the U.S. job market, one that may delay another cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve but does not slam the door on it.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.5% in midday trading and was on track to top its all-time high set earlier in the week.  The gains came after the U.S. Labor Department said employers hired fewer workers in total during December than economists expected, though the unemployment rate improved and was better than expected.",
