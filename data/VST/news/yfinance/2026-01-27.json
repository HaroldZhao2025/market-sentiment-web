    "summary": "What knocked trillions off of the value of the U.S. market was news that a Chinese AI company, DeepSeek, had nearly matched U.S. competitors that were spending fortunes on chips and electricity.  As Heard on the Street columnist Dan Gallagher explained at the time, the reaction was excessive and DeepSeek’s claims seemed exaggerated.  JPMorgan Asset Management says in a report that 42 AI-related companies have been responsible for between 65% and 75% of the S&P 500’s gains, earnings and capital spending since ChatGPT was launched in November 2022.",
