    "summary": "Vistra Energy (VIST) has emerged as the S&P 500's top performer in 2024, passing Nvidia (NVDA), as the utility holding company's stock has nearly quadrupled year-to-date. Schultze Asset Management founder and managing member George Schultze joins Brad Smith and Josh Lipton on Catalysts to discuss whether Vistra can continue its remarkable climb in 2025. Schultze notes that Vistra \"appears to have been oversold recently\" but expects it \"to rebound going forward as we get more fundamental news.\"  Its 2024 gains were largely supported by strategic acquisitions and artificial intelligence (AI)–driven power demand. Demand for electricity to power AI data centers is expected to continue with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) signing electricity agreements and pushing into nuclear energy.

    "summary": "Morning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Josh Lipton examine the standout performers in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for 2024. Vistra (VST) has emerged as the index's top performer, surpassing Nvidia's (NVDA) remarkable run. The company's performance can be attributed to robust earnings and strategic acquisitions, particularly its moves to establish a presence in the nuclear energy sector to meet growing artificial intelligence–related power demands. Nvidia maintains its position as the S&P 500's second-best performer. The semiconductor giant achieved a historic milestone this year by becoming the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalization, exceeding $3 trillion. However, the company continues to navigate challenges in the Chinese market. GE Vernova (GEV) also demonstrated impressive performance in 2024, posting a 143% gain following its April spinoff from General Electric. The company has further strengthened investor confidence by initiating its first dividend payment and upgrading its multiyear financial outlook.
