Western reagent suppliers including U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific and Germany's Merck have profited in the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market from the compounds used in lab tests for analysis and quality control.  But rising Chinese import tariffs due to the trade war with the U.S. and longer-term concerns about costs or access are spurring Chinese companies to request products from local rivals like Shanghai Titan Scientific and Nanjing Vazyme Biotech instead, the executives and managers said.",
