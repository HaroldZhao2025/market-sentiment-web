    "summary": "(Reuters) -Nutella spread maker Ferrero, armed with experience in health-regulated European markets and a track record of revamping struggling brands like Keebler cookies, has a good chance of reviving WK Kellogg's legacy cereal brands with its $3.1 billion take-private deal announced last week.  Ferrero, which makes sugary treats like Kinder chocolate eggs, Ferrero Rocher, and Tic Tac, has pursued an aggressive global expansion to boost revenue and diversify its portfolio beyond sweets into snacks, baked goods, and now breakfast cereals.  Under Chairman Giovanni Ferrero, the company has invested heavily in product innovation, reformulation and packaging redesign to turn around some challenged brands it previously acquired such as Keebler from Kellogg.",
