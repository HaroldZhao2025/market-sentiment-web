    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of winning security guarantees for his country in a conversation with the White House’s Ukraine envoy General Keith Kellogg, ahead of his meeting with President Trump later on Monday.  Sporting a black T-shirt alongside his suited colleagues, Zelensky told Kellogg the presence of European leaders with him at the White House would send a message of unity and support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity.  Kellogg has been a point man for Trump in relations with Zelensky and his team, and has made several visits to Kyiv this year in an effort to communicate the U.S. position and bring back an understanding of Ukraine’s red lines.",
