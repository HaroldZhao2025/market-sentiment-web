    "summary": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Mars' $36 billion bid for Pringles maker Kellanova is set to face a full-scale EU antitrust investigation, people close to the matter said on Wednesday, which could require the candy giant to divest assets to address competition concerns.  The European Commission, which acts as the antitrust watchdog in the 27-country bloc, is concerned about Mars' high market share in some products in some European Union countries and its portfolio of strong brands, the sources said.  Family-owned Mars is unlikely to offer remedies to assuage such concerns during the EU competition enforcer's preliminary review of the deal, which ends on June 25, the sources said.",
