      "summary": "(Reuters) -CSX Corp has named veteran executive Steve Angel its CEO, replacing Joe Hinrichs, as the U.S. railroad operator fends off pressure from an activist investor against the backdrop of rapid consolidation in the industry.  He became the chair in 2022 after he stepped down from the CEO role.  Since Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern's surprise $85 billion merger in the industry's largest-ever buyout, there has been mounting speculation about more big mergers, including one involving CSX.",
