Investors widely speculated that CSX would be an acquisition target once rumors of merger talks between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern emerged over the summer, because of the challenge of competing against a nationwide railroad.  CSX's stock nearly hit a new 52-week high last week at $37.25 before falling to $32.31 Tuesday after it became clear that neither BNSF nor CPKC railroads is pursuing the Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad, one of the six remaining major freight railroads in North America.",
