Buffett’s reluctance to issue stock reflects his view that his job is to build Berkshire’s intrinsic value per share.  The per-share part of that equation is critical; Berkshire stock would likely be at a fraction of its current level if Buffett issued gobs of shares for acquisitions rather than using cash from internally generated profits.",
