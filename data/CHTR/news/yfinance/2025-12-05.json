    "summary": "The San Francisco-based lender is helping provide a $59 billion bridge loan for the deal, along with BNP Paribas SA and HSBC Holdings Plc — though Wells Fargo is the only one among the three banks to snag an all-important advisory credit.  It’s a major win for Wells Fargo, which has set out in recent years to build a muscular investment-banking franchise nearly from scratch to rival top-tier dealmakers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  One of the linchpins of that strategy under Fernando Rivas, chief executive officer of corporate and investment banking, has been to use Wells Fargo’s position as one of the largest US business lenders to essentially ask borrowers for a seat at the table when it comes to arranging their mergers and acquisitions.",
