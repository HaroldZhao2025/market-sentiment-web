      "summary": "HONG KONG (Reuters) -Citigroup Inc will reduce the number of employees at two of its technology centres in China by about 3,500, the bank said on Thursday, as it pushes to simplify and shrink global tech operations to improve risk and data management.  The reduction of staff at the China Citi Solution Centres in Shanghai and Dalian is expected to be completed by the start of the fourth quarter this year, it said in a statement.  The bank said some of the roles would be moved to Citi's technology centres elsewhere, without specifying the number of jobs or specific locations.",
