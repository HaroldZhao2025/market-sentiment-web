Whalen Global Advisors Chairman Chris Whalen sits down with Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to talk more about the financial sector. Whalen Global Advisors LLC manages several indexes tracking bank stocks and the financial sector: the WGA Bank Top 10 Index (WBXSW), WGA Bank Top 25 Index (WBXXVW), WGA Bank Top 50 Index (WBLW).  \"We like to focus on quality and performance.
