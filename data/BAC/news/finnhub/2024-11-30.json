The Inflation Reduction Act has channeled billions of dollars to renewable-energy projects across the country, with Republican-led states getting the lion’s share of the funding.  A clash between Trump and congressional Republicans over the fate of the IRA would mark a high-stakes showdown determining the fate of hundreds of projects, billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs.",
