Fair to the companies, so they can support the economy… Fair to the consumers, fair to the investors and fair to the American economy.

He also calls for increasing the supply of housing and other commodities that are facing high demand. But despite his past work with President-elect Donald Trump, after his fifteen-year tenure as CEO of the major bank, Moynihan says he feels no need to get involved in politics, feeling he can have as much of an impact in his current role.
