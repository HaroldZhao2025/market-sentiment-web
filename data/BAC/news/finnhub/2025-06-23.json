In November 2023, BofA had agreed to pay a $12 million fine to settle CFPB charges that it routinely submitted inaccurate information about mortgage applicants to the federal government, in violation of longstanding laws.  The bank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, the CFPB was set to oversee the issue for five years unless it chose to end its oversight early.",
