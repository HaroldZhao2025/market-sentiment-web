    "summary": "For the year-to-date, the S&P 500 has posted a gain of 17% and has been notching record highs. The gains are even more impressive when we remember that the markets tanked this past spring; since that low point back in April, the index is up about 37%. While those gains are fostering an optimistic mood on Wall Street, some voices are counseling caution. Writing from Bank of America, strategist Savita Subramanian notes that there are bearish signals out there, and that investors should take care.",
