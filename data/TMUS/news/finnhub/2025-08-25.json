    "summary": "(Reuters) -U.S. tariffs and an appreciation in European currencies caused by dollar weakness have eroded companies' top line performance in the second quarter, increasing pressure on them to relocate operations or put jobs into the United States.  Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump put a 39% tariff rate on Swiss firms, prompting some to say they could consider moving operations stateside, adding to cases in the European Union and Britain facing tariffs of 15% or 10%.  The euro and the Swiss franc have jumped around 13% this year while sterling is up about 8% as uncertainty over Trump's policies and concern about rising U.S. debt hit the dollar.",
