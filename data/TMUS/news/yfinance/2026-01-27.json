T-Mobile US  and  Verizon Communications  are on bad runs too, sliding around 9% and 3% respectively.  Wall Street is also worried that the success of  Apple  iPhone 17 will drive up churn rates and kickstart a price war with rival Verizon, which may be looking to make changes under new CEO Daniel Schulman.",
