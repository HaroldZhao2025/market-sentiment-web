Robinson (CHRW); it is already reshaping how freight work gets done. On Opening Bid Unfiltered, C.H.

The market loves putting money to work on AI stocks; that much has been made clear in the past two years. The appetite to own AI plays is broadening to more under-the-radar names, including companies that are using the technology aggressively in the industrial sector. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with C.H. Robinson (CHRW) CEO Dave Bozeman. Bozeman has led the 120-year-old logistics player for more than two years, following considerable stints in transportation operations at Amazon, Harley-Davidson, and Caterpillar. Since his arrival, C.H. Robinson has leaned hard into AI to drive improved operating profits. The company has delivered in a big way, sending the stock price up 55% in 2025. Bozeman shares what’s next in the company’s tech-driven overhaul, what the future of freight looks like, and whether the trade war stands to send the US economy into a ditch ultimately.
