    "summary": "Investors are betting that lumber producer Weyerhaeuser will benefit from 25% tariffs placed on its competition from Canada, bidding up the Seattle firm's shares amid a broad selloff.  The idea is that Weyerhaeuser—which owns 10.4 million acres of timberland in the U.S., logging licenses on another 14 million acres in Canada as well as mills in both countries—will fetch higher prices for the lumber and wood panels it makes in the U.S. without having to pay the tariffs that add to the cost of wood crossing the border.  About 80% of Weyerhaeuser's lumber milling capacity is in the U.S., and it sells most of what it makes in Canada in that country, Chief Executive Devin Stockfish told investors recently.",
