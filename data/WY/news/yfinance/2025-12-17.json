Weyerhaeuser, which owns a fleet of sawmills and U.S. timberland that covers an area larger than Switzerland, has launched a venture with partner Aymium to turn the small trees and sawdust into a replacement for metallurgical coal used in the production of steel and other metals.  It's part of a broad initiative by Weyerhaeuser to boost its bottom line by $1.5 billion by 2025.",
