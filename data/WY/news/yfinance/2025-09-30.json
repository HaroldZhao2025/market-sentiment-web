    "headline": "Lumber Prices Rise on Trump’s New Tariff",
    "summary": "Lumber futures prices are trading higher after President Trump slapped a 10% tariff on wood imports in a Monday night executive order that cited national security.  Lumber prices have been on a rollercoaster this year, lifted by higher import taxes and tugged lower by the deteriorating housing and construction markets.  The climb from lows hit earlier this month is being propelled by Trump's tariff, which will become effective Oct. 14 and come on top of much higher duties on imports from Canada.",
