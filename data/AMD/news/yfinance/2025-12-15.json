    "summary": "Opening Bid Unfiltered is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. There has been one company at the very center of the AI trade this year. That is none other than OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)! OpenAI has won Yahoo Finance’s 11th annual Company of the Year award. Here is why. First, it undeniably led the market narrative for investors in 2025. When it announced big deals, stocks popped. When it issued a cautionary statement, stocks took a hit. Second, OpenAI secured scores of new, transformational deals with large public companies, including Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Oracle (ORCL). And three, its year of dealmaking will likely see the company end the year as the world’s most valuable private business — with an estimated valuation of $500 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talked exclusively with OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar about the company’s path forward — from eventually turning profitable to a potential push into hardware.
