    "summary": "STORY: President Donald Trump on Monday said Nvidia will be allowed to sell its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China—but at a price.The U.S. government will collect a 25% fee for each chip exported, higher than the 15% floated in August. A White House official says it will be collected as an import tax from Taiwan, where the chips are made, before they undergo U.S. security checks and head to China.Nvidia shares jumped after Trump’s announcement on Truth Social — up 2% after hours, following a 3% rise earlier on reports of the deal.Trump said he informed Chinese President Xi Jinping about the decision, and Xi responded positively, according to the post.Trump added that the U.S. Commerce Department is finalizing details of the deal and the same approach would apply to other AI chip firms such as AMD and Intel.The move appears to settle debate over whether American chipmakers should sell to China or hold back to protect U.S. dominance in AI. However, critics in Washington say shipping high-end AI chips to China risks supercharging its military.Democratic senators criticized the decision, calling it a major economic and national security failure.Experts say Nvidia's H200 is nearly six times more powerful than the H20, which is the most advanced chip currently allowed for export to China. But it’s still slower than Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, which U.S. firms use for AI training and deployment.",
