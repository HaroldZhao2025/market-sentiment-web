    "summary": "Futurum Group practice lead for devices Olivier Blanchard details his view on the semiconductor landscape following Nvidia's (NVDA) latest earnings report. \"We're in the middle of an AI transformation, a huge disruption,\" Blanchard told Catalysts. He praises Nvidia for being an early market entrant, capturing significant share and momentum that continues to build. \"It's gravy from here for a while now for them,\" he states. Despite Nvidia's minimal stock price reaction after its earnings beat, Blanchard tells Yahoo Finance: \"Every time these tech companies, especially chip companies, deliver outstanding results.... some people in the market are unhappy.\" However, he remains bullish on Nvidia's prospects, stating, \"Nvidia is on track to continue doing this for some time,\" adding \"There's nothing in the numbers that tells me they're not a good bet or not on the right track to expand [or] continue growth.\" Blanchard notes other standout performers in the space include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM).
