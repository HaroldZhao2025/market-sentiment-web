    "headline": "AI infrastructure, compute: Ben Bajarin's 2025 Big Tech predictions",
    "summary": "As the AI trade welcomes a variety of new participants and infrastructure components in 2025, Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin shares several of his Big Tech predictions for this year with Asking for a Trend's Josh Lipton. Bajarin names several of the typical players in the AI semiconductor space contributing to infrastructure, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell Technology (MRVL). \"A ton of growth still going on the infrastructure side, so I imagine that that that will continue,\" Bajarin states. \"We're going to continue to see a tremendous amount of demand for compute, that's not going away. But I think what I'm looking for in 2025 is the software monetization of those stocks.\" Bajarin also weighs in on the reported boost in productivity from executives after deploying AI agents across several industries, as well as what is to be expected on cloud computing spend and Apple's (AAPL) AI-enabled computers and smart devices.
