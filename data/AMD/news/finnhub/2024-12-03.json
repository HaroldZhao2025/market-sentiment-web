    "summary": "Over the past five decades, Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD (AMD), has become a staple of the tech industry. Let's take a closer look at the semiconductor company's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker. 1969 AMD was founded by Jerry Sanders and a group of seven other individuals. 1972 The company went public on September 27, 1972, at $15.50 per share, bringing in a a total of $7.5 million. 1982 AMD and its main competitor Intel (INTC) signed a 10-year technology exchange agreement, as part of a deal to supply chips to IBM (IBM). 1991 AMD released the Am386, its version of the Intel 386 microprocessor, leading to a legal battle between the two companies. 1994 AMD landed a major deal with Compaq to supply Am486 processors to power Compaq PCs. 1996 AMD purchased NexGen for $857 million in stock, to take on Intel’s Pentium line of chips. 1999 AMD introduced the Athlon processor, the first 1-GHz microprocessor. 2003 AMD launched the Opteron, the company's first server-oriented processor. 2006 AMD acquired ATI Technologies for $5.4 billion, pushing ahead into the graphics card business for high-end gaming and design PCs. 2009 Intel agreed to paid AMD $1.25 billion as part of the pairs’ long-running antitrust battle. 2013 Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SONY) chose AMD as the chip provider for the Xbox One and PS4 game consoles. 2017 AMD debuted its new Ryzen line of chips aimed directly at taking on Intel’s top-of-the-line offerings. 2023 AMD acquired open-source AI software provider Nod.ai to boost its AI capabilities. Behind the AI wave, AMD hopes to continue riding this momentum well into the future. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.
