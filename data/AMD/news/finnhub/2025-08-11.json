    "summary": "(Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump upended decades of U.S. national security policy, creating an entirely new category of corporate risk, when he made a deal with Nvidia  to give the U.S. government a cut of its sales in exchange for resuming exports of banned AI chips to China.  Historically, the U.S. government made decisions to control the export of sensitive technologies on national security grounds.  On Monday, Trump raised the prospect of ending that era, saying he would allow Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% cut of the company's sales of some advanced chips in that country.",
