Nvidia on Thursday invested $5 billion in Intel for a stake of roughly 4%, and the two firms agreed to a deal to supply chips to one another to create \"multiple generations\" of joint products.  This could give Intel a leg up against rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices because its chips will be attached to Nvidia's flagship products in a way that no other third-party chips currently are, analysts said.",
