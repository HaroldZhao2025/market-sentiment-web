Host Brad Smith to discuss his strategy amid current market conditions ahead of Trump's second term in the White House. Bido indicates he expects the market's \"choppiness\" to continue, given ongoing geopolitical uncertainty with Ukraine launching US-made missiles into Russia after receiving the OK from US President Joe Biden, saying, \"That's going to be part of life in 2025.\" The strategist says, \"I like three companies in particular. I like First Solar (FSLR). I like AMD (AMD). And I like Burlington (BURL). And for different reasons.\" Bido explains, \"First Solar is super interesting for me because I think the combination of Trump and Elon Musk is good for solar.\" He adds, \"I think AMD is a good buy. You know it has the right earnings and revenue acceleration despite the fact that it just took a little bit of a downturn.\" The strategist says Burlington is also \"a good pick\" because \"it's in the retail space. And if you think about it, I'm going a little bit diversified here, poking in all different directions.\" Watch the video above for more on Bido's strategy and why he chose First Solar, AMD, and Burlington as top picks.
