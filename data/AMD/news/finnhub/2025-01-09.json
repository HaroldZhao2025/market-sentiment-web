Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley catches up with AMD's senior vice president and general manager of client business, Rahul Tikoo, to discuss the new AI chips, the power of AI PCs, and AMD's competitive positioning. Tikoo discusses the current evolution of AI PCs. \"We're in the iPhone moment right now in the PC industry,\" he says. The executive explains that AMD focuses on three areas for its client business unit: consumer PCs, commercial PCs, and AI PCs. \"Whether it's consumer or commercial, everyone is going to be using AI PCs because, in the end, that experience is going to be so compelling it's going to be an experience that they just can't live without.\" As chipmakers and Big Tech companies compete to capture market share in the AI era, Tikoo notes, \"I'm not worried about the competition. I welcome the competition ... we've been doing it successfully for 40 years, and we'll hopefully continue to do this and grow.\" \"We're an end-to-end provider,\" Tikoo adds. \"If you think about our breadth and what we're doing in this space, going all the way from data centers and cloud providers to on [premium] providers to data center GPUs to embedded processors and technologies in cars and other devices to our PCs and edge devices ... if a company is really thinking about a partner that they can partner with end to end, AMD is one of the very, very few companies in the world that they can do that with.\" This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.
