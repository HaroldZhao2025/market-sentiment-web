    "summary": "General Mills  stock tumbled Tuesday after the company—known for brands such as Cheerios, Pillsbury and Betty Crocker—lowered its sales outlook because of weaker-than-expected consumer demand.  Campbell  shares dropped 8%,  Lamb Weston  fell 6.3%, while Conagra Brands and  Kraft Heinz  lost 5.8% and 5.2%, respectively.  General Mills told investors at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference that it now expects overall sales to fall about 1.5% to 2% in its 2026 fiscal year ending in May—putting the company on track for a third straight year of sales declines.",
