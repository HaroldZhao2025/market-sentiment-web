Economists are expecting 75,000 jobs to have been added in August, a slight increase from the 73,000 added in July. On Thursday, White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman Stephen Miran will attend his Senate Banking nomination hearing, which will determine whether he is sworn in as Federal Reserve governor to replace Adriana Kugler.
