The rapid build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure by U.S. tech firms such ​as OpenAI, Alphabet-owned  Google and Microsoft has absorbed much of the world's memory chip supply, pushing up prices as manufacturers prioritize components for higher-margin data ‌centers over consumer devices.  Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, the world's three largest producers of memory chips, have said in recent months that they were struggling to keep up with demand as they reported rosy quarterly ‌earnings on the back of surging prices for their semiconductors.",
