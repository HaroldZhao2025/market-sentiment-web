    "summary": "The U.S. government negotiated lower prices in the federal Medicare program for 15 high-selling medicines including Ozempic, widening an effort to rein in drug costs.  The new prices, which will take effect in 2027, shave 38% to 85% off the list prices for drugs for diseases including asthma, cancer and diabetes.  The reductions are estimated to save Medicare, the health-insurance program for the elderly, $12 billion.",
