Eli Lilly  and  Novo Nordisk’s  GLP-1 drugs currently dominate the obesity-drug market, but big drugmakers including Roche, Pfizer and Amgen, as well as smaller players, are trying to come up with new treatments to challenge them.  Roche is looking to establish an obesity franchise with several drug candidates under development that it aims to launch as standalone treatments or combined among them, with the goal of becoming a top three player in the market.",
