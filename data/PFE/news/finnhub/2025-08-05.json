    "summary": "(Reuters) -Pfizer raised its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday while reporting second-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, and said it expects to benefit from cost-cutting and a weaker dollar.  The New York-based drugmaker said the new forecast absorbs a one-time charge of 20 cents per share related to its licensing deal with China's 3SBio for an experimental cancer treatment.  Pfizer shares rose about 2% to $24 in premarket trading.",
