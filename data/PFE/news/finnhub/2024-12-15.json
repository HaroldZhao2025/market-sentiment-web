    "summary": "With a market capitalization of more than $143 billion today, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) stock won't make anyone into a millionaire unless they're willing to commit a large amount of capital and then hold the stock for a very long period of time, reinvesting all the dividends they receive along the way.  There's no evidence that Pfizer is about to change its business model in a radical way which might challenge that dynamic.  One of the most obvious ways that a stock can help to boost your portfolio's value is by paying a dividend consistently over time.",
