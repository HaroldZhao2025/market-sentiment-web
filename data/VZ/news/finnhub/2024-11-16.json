Yields generally correlate negatively with stock price movements, after all, so higher yields often reflect a business' underperformance and investors' lack of confidence in its rebound potential.  One popular tactic that investors use in an attempt to minimize those risks is to focus on high-quality companies that might just be going through rough patches.",
