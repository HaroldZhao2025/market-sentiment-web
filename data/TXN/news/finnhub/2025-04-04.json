    "summary": "Shares of analog chip manufacturer Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) fell 6.3% in the afternoon session after China imposed a 34% tariff on all U.S. imports amid escalating trade war tensions. This was especially rough for the US chipmakers because a big chunk of their business leans on demand out of China. The new tariffs not only threaten to erode profit margins but also risk reducing market share.",
