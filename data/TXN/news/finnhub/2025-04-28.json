    "summary": "Shares of silicon carbide chipmaker Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF) rocketed 26.9% on Monday.  With such a sky-high short interest of 41% of shares outstanding and 64% of Wolfspeed's float as of April 15, it appears as though many short sellers have decided -- or have been forced -- to close out their positions, leading to a \"short squeeze.\"  Wolfspeed has spent billions of dollars and taken on significant debt in order to build out silicon carbide (SiC) manufacturing capacity in the U.S. SiC is a difficult material to work with, but it also makes for a more conductive chip, which is especially useful in high-voltage, high-temperature applications like electric vehicles (EV) and other industrial infrastructure.",
