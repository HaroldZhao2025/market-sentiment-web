    "headline": "Big Tech CapEx: How Nvidia actually stands to gain from DeepSeek",
    "summary": "As earnings season continues for most of the Big Tech landscape, Wall Street investors have become increasingly focused on tech giant's and hyperscaler's capital expenditure (CapEx) spending on AI. To talk more about how AI CapEx guidance is weighing on Big Tech and semiconductor manufacturers like Nvidia (NVDA), Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska sits down with Seana Smith on Catalysts. Delevska finds the release of DeepSeek's large-language model to have been a positive for Nvidia: \"The market completely misinterpreted this to begin with. I think it may be negative for some of the other companies in the value chain, like open source models, but for companies that are making hardware, more innovation is always, by definition, better.\" Delevska goes on to comment on how cheaper AI chip models could benefit Cloudflare (NET), Arista's (ANET) position in AI networking, and reacts to reports of OpenAI's plans to develop their first custom chip design. The last of the Magnificent Seven to report its latest quarterly performance, Nvidia is scheduled to release earnings results on Wednesday, February 26.
