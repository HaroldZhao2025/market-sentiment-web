    "summary": "CEOs of the 10 largest U.S. utilities earned more than $115 million combined in a recent three-year period as demand for electricity from their power plants jumped substantially due to the burgeoning cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors.  At seven of the companies, CEO payouts were much larger than what the utilities estimated at the time of their stock grants in early 2022, according to a Reuters analysis of pay disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Constellation Energy Group CEO Joseph Dominguez received stock now worth $40.3 million, or twice the target amount estimated, the company disclosed.",
