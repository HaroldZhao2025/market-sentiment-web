    "headline": "2025 will be a 'show-me' year for nuclear: Expert",
    "summary": "Nuclear energy emerged as a focal point of discussion in 2024. To provide corporate insight on this growing trend, Radiant Energy Group managing director Mark Nelson joined Brad Smith and Josh Lipton on Morning Brief. Nelson reflects on the evolution of nuclear energy's prominence, noting that, while 2023 saw increased interest from tech companies, 2024 was \"like the whole world discovered nuclear.\" He explains that the intersection of artificial intelligence and energy requirements led to a realization that \"the tech players didn't have a realistic energy-growth strategy,\" creating an opening for nuclear energy. However, he cautions that despite numerous \"commitments\" from major companies this year, 2025 \"will be the year of 'show me.'\" \"I think what's become clear is that the top executives of these companies were sort of blindsided by the energy problem, and they're scrambling to learn as much about energy as quickly possible,\" Nelson tells Yahoo Finance. While noting that \"nuclear is a special form of energy,\" he remains optimistic about infrastructure development in 2025, stating that \"the noise is all in the right direction.\" Nelson also comments on President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Energy leadership nomination of Chris Wright, saying, \"I've heard nothing but good things.\" He adds, \"When I see Chris Wright coming in, I see somebody who loves what he's heard from the nuclear story, and his job at the Department of Energy will be to see how he can continue the momentum.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.
