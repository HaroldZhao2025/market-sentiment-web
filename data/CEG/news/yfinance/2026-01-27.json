As Heard on the Street columnist Dan Gallagher explained at the time, the reaction was excessive and DeepSeek’s claims seemed exaggerated.  JPMorgan Asset Management says in a report that 42 AI-related companies have been responsible for between 65% and 75% of the S&P 500’s gains, earnings and capital spending since ChatGPT was launched in November 2022.",
