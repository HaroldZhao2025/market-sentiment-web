    "summary": "Microsoft has promised to keep buying enough renewable energy to match all its electricity needs after meeting that ‌goal for the first time last year, as tech giants ramp up ‌capital expenditure on an AI-fuelled expansion of power-hungry data centres.  The company said on Wednesday that it had reached ​its 2025 goal by contracting 40 gigawatts of new renewable energy supply, mainly through power purchase agreements - long-term contracts that help utility providers to bring new projects forward.  Nineteen gigawatts of that renewable energy has already been supplied to the power grid, Microsoft said, with ‌the rest to follow over ⁠the next five years and covering 26 countries in total.",
