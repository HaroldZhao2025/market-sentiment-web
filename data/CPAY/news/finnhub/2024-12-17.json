The announcement roiled the capital, with one of Trudeau’s most loyal and trusted lieutenants choosing to leave after publishing a stinging letter critical of the government’s direction on fiscal policy.  The move came on the same day Freeland was scheduled to introduce a fall economic statement, which showed sharply wider budget deficits than the government promised just a year ago.",
