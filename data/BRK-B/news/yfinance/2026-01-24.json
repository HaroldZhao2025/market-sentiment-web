    "summary": "A major winter storm advancing across the southern and eastern United States this weekend won’t just test municipal snow crews and utility companies’ gridlines.  With freezing temperatures, snow, sleet, and ice expected to sweep through millions of households, policyholders will likely file loss reports in the weeks and months ahead, ranging from auto accidents and property damage to burst pipes and roof collapses.  Although winter storms are often viewed as less severe weather events than hurricanes or earthquakes, they can lead to meaningful losses for residential and commercial property owners and impact automobiles and infrastructure across a broad swath of the country.",
