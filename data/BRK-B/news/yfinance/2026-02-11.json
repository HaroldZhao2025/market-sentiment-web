    "summary": "Shares of  Kraft Heinz  tumbled Wednesday as the packaged-food giant announced it would pause a planned split into two companies and issued a dim 2026 forecast.  Kraft Heinz  had planned to divide its faster-growing brands like Heinz and Philadelphia cream cheese into an independent company called Global Taste Elevation, while a separate company North American Grocery would own brands facing bigger challenges.  New CEO Steve Cahillane suspended that plan Wednesday.",
