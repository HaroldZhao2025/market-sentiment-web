    "summary": "Back in the 1970s when silver prices were soaring, investors gravitated toward an unusual silver play—pre-1965 U.S. coins that have 90% silver content.  Now that silver prices surging again, those pre-1965 silver coins amount to one of several ways to invest in physical silver besides silver bars and more recently minted silver coins like U.S. Eagles.  The older silver coins, generally sold as bags with denominations of $1,000 (face value) of U.S. coins or less, trade for a small premium above their silver value.",
