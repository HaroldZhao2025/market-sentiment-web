Ahead of Occidental's Tuesday report, analysts predict Q3 EPS coming in at 74 cents per share, down 37% compared to $1.18 per share a year ago, with revenue totaling $7.12 billion, running basically flat vs. Q3 2023.  Occidental Petroleum is coming off a big expectations beat in Q2, when it saw a surprise 51% profit increase, breaking a string of five consecutive quarterly earnings declines.",
