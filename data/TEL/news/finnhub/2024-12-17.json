The firm is also updating 2024-2028 estimates to reflect lower global LVP. Wells is now about 4% below consensus sales and about 6% below consensus on EBIT/DA. After a challenging 2024, 2025 looks much the same with four main challenges, the firm says. First, tariff challenges could impact U.S. suppliers who source from within North America.",
