        "description": "",
        "summary": "Occidental Petroleum stock jumped around 6% ahead of the open Thursday after its fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations.  The oil and gas producer’s shares rose 5.8% to $49.85 in premarket trading, after it published earnings late Wednesday.  Its peers were also up early Thursday—as oil prices climbed around 1.5% due to ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Iran—but by a smaller margin.",
