    "summary": "(Reuters) -U.S. shale firm Occidental Petroleum said on Wednesday the prices it received for oil and gas production during the first quarter were higher than in the preceding three months.  Benchmark Brent crude prices averaged $74.98 a barrel during the first quarter, up 1.3% from the prior quarter, while U.S. natural gas prices jumped 30%, helped by higher demand from a cold winter in the country.  Last week, industry bellwether Exxon Mobil also signaled higher oil and gas prices and stronger refining margins would help lift its earnings by roughly $900 million.",
