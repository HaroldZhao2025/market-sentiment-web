    "summary": "Investors often turn to Warren Buffett for advice for one good reason: He's proven his ability to navigate any investing waters -- from moments of euphoria to the doldrums -- and win over time.  Buffett doesn't rush to buy the hottest stocks as markets soar and doesn't panic-sell during difficult periods.  This strategy has helped him lead Berkshire Hathaway to a compounded annual gain of more than 19% over 58 years -- that's compared to an increase of about 10% for the S&P 500 index.",
