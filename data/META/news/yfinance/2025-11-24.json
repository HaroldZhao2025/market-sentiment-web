        "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -A rush of bond sales by major tech firms to fund artificial intelligence expansion is creating a high-stakes bet for the $9 trillion U.S. corporate ​bond market, prompting caution from prominent investors like DoubleLine over the sector's growing debt load.  Several analysts forecast higher amounts of hyperscaler debt issuance next year as big tech firms race to finance AI-ready data centers.  High-grade bond markets may need to absorb $1.5 trillion of AI data center bond sales over the next five years, with that type of debt potentially representing ⁠over 20% of the investment-grade ‌bond market by 2030, J.P. Morgan analysts estimated recently.",
