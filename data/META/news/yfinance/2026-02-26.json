    "summary": "While explosive sales growth has turned Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia into the world’s most valuable company — sending shares up about 44% in the last 12 months — investors are seeking stronger assurances that the booming spending can be maintained.  Shareholders still have questions “over whether the current AI spending wave can sustain growth beyond the next few years, and whether Nvidia will remain as dominant as AI shifts from training models to running everyday tasks,” analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown said in a note after the results.  Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang pushed back on the concerns during Wednesday’s call, arguing that customers are already making money from their newly acquired computing power.",
