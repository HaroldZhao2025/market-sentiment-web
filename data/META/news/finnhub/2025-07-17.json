Meta was not a defendant and declined to comment.The parties did not disclose details of the settlement.The shareholders' lawyer, Sam Closic, said the agreement came together quickly.It was reached before any high-profile executives like Zuckerberg or former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg were to testify.In 2017, Zuckerberg was expected to testify at a trial involving another lawsuit by company investors, but that case was also settled before he took the stand.A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
