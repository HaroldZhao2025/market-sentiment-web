While it may sound like science fiction to many, major companies, like Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) are investing in these technologies, and a handful of companies are working to make it a reality, including Precision Neuroscience. Co-founded by CEO Michael Mager and neurosurgeon and engineer Ben Rapoport, Precision Neuroscience began in 2021 with three former employees of Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Precision Neuroscience is developing its version of an implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) technology meant to help individuals with neurological disorders, such as ALS, to better function and communicate. Mager says Precision Neuroscience's technology is high-bandwidth, sits on \"the surface of the brain without doing any damage,\" and is reversible.  In an interview with Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Yasmin Khorram from the Yahoo Invest conference, Mager discusses the company's road ahead and potential market, what to expect from the upcoming Trump presidency, and a possible IPO. “We view brain computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation,” says Mager. “This is gonna have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas.” To see every interview from Yahoo Finance Invest, click here.
