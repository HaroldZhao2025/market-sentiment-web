Investors are returning to the Magnificent 7 names because these stocks provide both offensive and defensive strategies in the current market landscape. \"These companies as a whole... really have impressive operating leverage,\" Mazza notes. With uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs and inflation in the upcoming year, investors are seeking companies that can \"power through\" economic challenges, which increasingly points them toward the Magnificent Seven. Despite this focus, Mazza adds: \"I think there is a general sentiment that the economy is okay, and we have so much positive investor sentiment right now, and that to me is what's really pushing the market higher.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.
