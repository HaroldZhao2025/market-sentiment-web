The stock is down nearly 30% from the all-time high it reached in February, while the S&P 500 is off by almost 18%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down almost 23%, firmly in bear market territory.  Meta owns the popular apps Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Messenger, and WhatsApp, so it isn't directly affected by the tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed on imported goods from nearly every country.",
