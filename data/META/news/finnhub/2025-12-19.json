    "summary": "STORY: The deal to hand control of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a group of investors, including Oracle, marked a major turning point after years of uncertainty over the future of the popular video app.But former Peking University business professor Jeffrey Towson says it raises new questions about the new entity’s ability to compete.\"It's not obvious what happens with this company going forward because you just went from a global platform to a regional one, but your competitors are still global. Their primary competitors are YouTube and Facebook, Instagram reels. Well, if they're separate, then they are dramatically smaller than the global giants, which was not the case last month. So that has some interesting, sort of, business strategy and competition questions that get raised.\"The deal is aimed at avoiding a U.S. ban of the short video app, which is used regularly by more than 170 million Americans.It comes after a yearslong saga to force TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its U.S. operation, which began in August 2020, when President Donald Trump first tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over U.S. national security concerns.Financial terms of the deal, announced in an internal memo by TikTok (U.S.) seen by Reuters, were not disclosed.The White House said in September the new joint venture would operate TikTok's U.S. app, but questions remain about the deal, including the business relationships between the new joint venture and ByteDance… which will still own about 20% of the U.S. company.Sources told Reuters in September that ByteDance would also own a separate division that would control the revenue-generating business operations such as e-commerce and advertising.Those arrangements formed the deal framework announced on Thursday, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday.\"The big question is still, is Chinese government going to approve this? Because they've never actually said that they would. The Trump administration has said its been approved by them, but we've never actually heard anything from the Chinese government formally. Now, who knows what's going on behind closed doors? In theory, that could happen quite quickly or it could emerge as a problem. I suspect it's probably not a problem, but we don't actually know the other major party at the table in terms of the decision making here.\"Oracle will own the majority of the joint venture along with private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX.Shares of Oracle rose as much as 8% in Friday morning trading.",
