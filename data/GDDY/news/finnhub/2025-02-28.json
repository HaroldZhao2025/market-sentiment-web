    "headline": "How GoDaddy's founder turned adversity to opportunity",
    "summary": "On this week’s episode of Warrior Money, special guest Bob Parsons—a Marine Corps veteran and pioneering entrepreneur—joined hosts Patrick Murphy and Dan Kunze to share his remarkable journey from a challenging East Baltimore upbringing to becoming one of Forbes 400’s wealthiest Americans. Parsons offered candid advice for aspiring entrepreneurs, urging them to choose a business they love and to embrace responsibility and discipline. “Pick the right business and don’t waste time worrying,” he said, highlighting how the resilience and work ethic he developed in the Marine Corps laid the foundation for his success. The conversation also focused on Parsons’s early ventures. Starting Parson Technology with just $40,000, he eventually sold the company for $64 million—a breakthrough that propelled him into subsequent successes, including co-founding GoDaddy (GDDY) and supporting the Bob & Renee Parsons Foundation. Through his work with the Semper Fi Fund, his philanthropic efforts have raised over $234 million to assist veterans. Parsons also opened up about his personal battle with PTSD following his Vietnam service. Reflecting on his journey toward healing, he described how reconnecting with fellow veterans and exploring alternative treatments, including psychedelics, helped him reclaim his well-being. Hosted by former Congressman Patrick Murphy and veteran investor Dan Kunze, Yahoo Finance’s Warrior Money is a weekly vodcast dedicated to uplifting military veterans transitioning into civilian life. You can catch every episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, or wherever you get your podcasts. Through insights from fellow veterans and high-ranking officials, Murphy and Kunze are helping set vets up for success through financial education and inspiration.
