Buying the owner of marquee franchises including \"Game of Thrones\", \"DC Comics\" and \"Harry Potter\" will further tilt the power balance in Hollywood in favor of the streaming giant that built its dominance without major acquisitions or a large content library, helping its efforts to ward off competition ⁠from Walt Disney and the Ellison family-backed Paramount.",
