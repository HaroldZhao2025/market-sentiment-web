    "headline": "There are no 'easy solutions' for Disney, analyst says",
    "summary": "Disney (DIS) reports earnings on Thursday, and investors will likely watch for updates on its parks and streaming businesses and any insights into CEO Bob Iger's succession plans. TD Cowen managing director of media and entertainment Doug Creutz, who has a Hold rating on the stock, explains why he is on the sidelines on Disney. Creutz says \"it's a combination of a few things\" driving his Hold rating, specifically a difficult setup for continued margin expansion in its parks segment after \"an incredible run in the parks division for the last few years coming out of the pandemic,\" headwinds in linear media, and weak subscriber growth in its streaming business. He adds, \"I think [Disney is] fine,\" but \"without knowing who's going to succeed [CEO Bob Iger after his 2026 retirement], it's very hard to get too bullish about the company.\" The analyst says, \"I don't know that there [are] any easy solutions here, which is why I have a Hold [rating] on [Disney stock], because I think if there was something I thought that they could do to make things a lot better, I sort of think they also would do it. And I just don't think there's any great silver bullets here to solve some of the issues they have.\" For more on Disney's position going into its fourth quarter earnings report, how Disney+ stacks up to Netflix (NFLX), and more, watch the video above.

Tomicki says, \"Disney is really a combination of several businesses rolled into one.

Disney CEO Bob Iger has said that Netflix (NFLX) is \"the gold standard when it comes to streaming\" and what Disney+ strives to be. Tomicki tells Yahoo Finance that he thinks Netflix-level results are \"possible,\" but \"it requires a complete rethink of how you create content and what is the definition of great content.\" He explains that the company needs shows like Netflix's \"Too Hot to Handle,\" saying, \"What matters is that people keep watching and are hooked to your platform and are willing to pay for it, so the thinking has to change. It is possible, but we're not seeing much of that change at Disney yet.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.
