    "summary": "Disney (DIS) is set to merge Hulu+ Live TV with Fubo (FUBO) in a surprise deal announced Monday. Wedbush equity research managing director Michael Pachter joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss what it means for the company's live TV offerings. Patcher compares the Disney-Fubo deal with T-Mobile (TMUS) merging with Sprint to become \"a very strong number three,\" adding, \"Hulu and Disney are very powerful, and I think there's a great combination.\" The addition of Fubo to Disney's live TV options bolsters the company's position to compete with YouTube, owned by Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). \"I'm really encouraged that the Fubo guys are in charge of this combined enterprise. They have had to kind of survive in an environment where they were outgunned, outmanned, out capitalized, and now they're getting a big balance sheet behind them.\" Watch the video above to learn more about the analyst's expectations for media dealmaking in 2025 as President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House.
