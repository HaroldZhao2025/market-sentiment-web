    "summary": "Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger is set to retire in 2026, but the company has yet to announce who will succeed Iger. The CEO has been a big part of the company's recent turnaround, with the company's CFO Hugh Johnston telling Yahoo Finance, \"The magic is back at Disney\" under Iger's leadership. The Wall Street Journal reporter Robbie Whelan sits down with Market Domination Overtime Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to share what he's learned reporting on Iger's approaching succession. Johnston reported that Disney is considering external candidates for the soon-to-be-open CEO role, including Andrew Wilson, the EA CEO. \"Wilson has a pretty, pretty long-standing relationship with the company. He's known Bob Iger for a pretty long time ... The first major kind of encounter between the two, the two men and the two companies, was in 2018 when Andrew Wilson interviewed for the job of head of ESPN, a job that eventually went to Jimmy Pitaro, who is also in the mix as a potential CEO succession candidate.\" Iger has reportedly checked in with Ted Sarandos, a co-CEO at Netflix (NFLX) to ask how the two-person CEO structure has worked out for the streaming giant. Johnston says, \"The two names that everyone has in mind when it comes to a potential co-CEO arrangement at Disney are Dana Walden, the co-chair of their entertainment division, and Josh D'Amaro, the chairman of the experiences division.\" The reporter notes, \"It's unclear if that same structure would really work at Disney the way it has so well at Netflix.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.

Tigress Financial Partners CIO Ivan Feinseth joins The Morning Brief to discuss these earnings results. \"It was a great quarter. I think they're definitely turning a corner. I continue to say that content is king, and Disney is the king of content. And the power of their content goes beyond just streaming or even theaters. It goes into the parks. It goes to licensing [and] product sales. So they get multiple bites at the apple for all of the content that they produce. They're just great at telling stories and making great content that resonates across all demographics and endures,\" Feinseth says. \"The profit in streaming is just really a powerful statement,\" the strategist adds, noting that he expects streaming gains to offset linear losses. \"I believe we will continue to see the growth in streaming. They have multiple platforms addressing multiple audiences. I mean, live sports is also a powerful driver of viewership. They have both the fully paid-for subscription model and an advertising paid subscription model, which they're expanding. [There are] more and more companies [that] want to advertise on platforms [where] they can better target the audience and get a better response and measure of the return on their invested advertising dollar. And Disney helps with that.\" With Disney CEO Bob Iger set to retire in 2026, investors wait for the company to announce his successor. Feinseth says, \"Iger has been an incredible CEO. He came back, and he's doing an incredible job. And one of the things I believe a good CEO does is to build an enterprise that endures, and whoever takes over will continue to build on the success that he has built.\" The strategist adds he hopes Iger's successor is an internal hire.

    "summary": "Disney (DIS) shares are trading higher after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and provided strong guidance. Disney CFO Hugh Johnston sits down with Yahoo Finance’s Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the print and what's next for the company. The CFO tells Yahoo Finance there are “a couple of things going on right now,” saying, “Obviously, 2024 was a terrific year, and Q4 was a great cap to a terrific year, 6% revenue growth, 21% [return on investment] ROI and then, of course, 39% [earning per share] EPS growth.” Johnston adds, “In terms of the way we thought about the business, we've got two back-to-back billion-dollar movies. We've got terrific things going on with women's college basketball and college football. So, [we] certainly feel great about all of that. In addition to that, the streaming service now has turned significantly profitable for two quarters in a row. And then, of course, we had a record year in the experiences business. And then, last but not least, streaming. We added about six million subs over the third quarter. So I think it's a combination of all of those factors and the portfolio working.” “The fact that we've been investing in those things as well is, and the fact that we've got sort of good visibility into the future is what has led us to provide forward guidance and, I think, the confidence that we have in those investments, whether it's the investments in streaming or the investments in the experiences business, is what's leading investors to basically look at the guidance and say, 'Yeah, this is something that that we're really bought into.’ We feel very positively about it,” he says. Johnston explains that the strategy under CEO Bob Iger’s leadership is to focus on quality content rather than quantity. “A few years ago, we were producing a lot of content to try to fill the streaming service, and we stretched ourselves in some ways, probably too thin. One of the things that Bob Iger said when he came back is I want to put creativity back into the center … I do think that that focus on raising the bar on quality and delivering, really, I think, the best content in the industry is, is an indication that the magic is back at Disney.\" Watch the video above for more about Disney’s streaming business, content strategy, experiences segment, the impact of the upcoming Trump administration, and more.
