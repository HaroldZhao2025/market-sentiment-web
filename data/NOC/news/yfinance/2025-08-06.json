    "summary": "(Reuters) -Northrop Grumman-backed Firefly Aerospace priced its upsized U.S. initial public offering at $45 per share on Wednesday, raising $868.3 million, and indicating strong demand for the buzzy space technology startup that put a lander on the moon.  In a nascent but rapidly growing commercial space industry, Firefly's IPO has attracted investor attention because it successfully landed its uncrewed Blue Ghost spacecraft on the moon in its first attempt in March.  U.S. President Donald Trump's focus on commercializing space technology and safeguarding the national interests in space has attracted venture capital firms and billionaires.",
