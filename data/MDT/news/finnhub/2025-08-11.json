    "summary": "It seems \"pay to play\" may be the name of the game for corporate leaders under the second Trump administration. Nvidia (NVDA) and, reportedly, AMD (AMD), will give the US government 15% of their China chip sales. The artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker deal comes after the Trump administration secured an additional $100 billion investment from Apple (AAPL), which seemed to mitigate the president's tariff threats. Harvard University executive fellow and former Medtronic CEO Bill George and Pangaea Policy founder Terry Haines examine what the deal signals about the state of corporate America under Trump and how the president is blurring the lines between government and free-market capitalism.
