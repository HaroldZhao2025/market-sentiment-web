The BLS was due to publish its September jobs report at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, but the ongoing government shutdown will delay that release indefinitely.  Curiously, despite a weaker-than-expected reading for private job creation from payroll processing group ADP earlier this week, and data from Challenger Gray showing the weakest hiring intentions since 2009, investors appear relatively sanguine with the lack of official figures from the BLS.",
