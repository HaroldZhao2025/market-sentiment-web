The human resources ‌software provider's fourth-quarter subscription revenue forecast was also barely above estimates, hit by sluggish demand from certain higher education customers that depend heavily on federal ⁠funding. Workday competes with Oracle,‌ SAP and payroll providers such as Automatic Data Processing.",
