    "summary": "A much-anticipated employment report on Friday showed job growth was below forecasts last month, leaving intact expectations for additional Fed interest-rate cuts to support the economy.  The result confirmed confidence in bets that short-maturity Treasuries, which are the most sensitive to the central bank’s policy, will outpace their longer-term counterparts this year, widening the yield gap between those maturities.  The gap between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields reached the largest in almost nine months last week.",
