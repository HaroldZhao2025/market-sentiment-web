The survey’s index of input prices, meanwhile, surged to a reading of 70, the highest in 3 years, and followed a better-than-expected reading of private sector employment gains published by payroll processing group ADP.",

        "description": "",
        "summary": "The dollar jumped to its highest level in five months Wednesday, powered by stronger-than-expected jobs and activity data that could test market expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut at its December policy meeting.  The Institute for Supply Management’s benchmark reading of business activity in the services sector, the domestic economy’s principal engine, hit an eight-month high of 52.4 in October, firmly north of the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.  The survey’s index of input prices, meanwhile, surged to a reading of 70, the highest in 3 years, and followed a better-than-expected reading of private sector employment gains published by payroll processing group ADP.",
