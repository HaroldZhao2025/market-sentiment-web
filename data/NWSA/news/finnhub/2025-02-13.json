    "summary": "The Atlantic, Politico, Vox and other major publishers are suing AI startup Cohere for copyright and trademark infringement, escalating the news industry’s legal battle over the technology.  The publishers are accusing the Canadian company, which they say is valued at over $5 billion, of improperly using at least 4,000 copyrighted works to train its large language model and of displaying large portions of or entire articles for users while bypassing visits to the publishers’ websites.  In some cases, according to the suit, Cohere is also infringing on publishers’ trademarks by delivering “hallucinated” material—with information that wasn’t actually published by the outlet—under a publisher’s name.",
