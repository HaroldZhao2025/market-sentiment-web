    "summary": "A federal judge in Florida dismissed cable news channel  Newsmax’s  antitrust lawsuit against rival Fox News Friday, but kept the door open for Newsmax to refile its complaint.  Newsmax filed the suit against Fox News and parent  Fox  earlier in the week, alleging that Fox’s deals with pay-TV distributors include onerous conditions that harm the ability of competitors to play on a level field.  Newsmax alleged in its suit Wednesday that Fox News uses its strength at the top-rated news channel to “coerce distributors into unfair terms that either prevent those distributors from carrying competitors of Fox News.”",
