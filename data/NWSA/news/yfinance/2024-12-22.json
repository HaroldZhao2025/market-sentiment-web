    "summary": "News Corp has agreed to sell its Australian cable-TV unit Foxtel to British-owned sports network DAZN for A$3.4 billion ($2.1 billion) including debt, cutting the Murdoch-controlled media empire's exposure to a business upended by streaming platforms. News Corp will gain a board seat and hold a 6% stake in DAZN, a London-headquartered streaming platform, while DAZN (pronounced Da Zone) gains streaming rights to Australian Football League and the National Rugby League. As Foxtel navigates expensive sports rights and competes with global digital behemoths, the deal highlights News Corp's push to streamline its portfolio as Rupert Murdoch shapes the future of his media empire.",
