    "summary": "Cross-market home shopping continued to dominate the U.S. housing landscape in the final quarter of 2025. According to a new report from Realtor.com®, out-of-market shoppers accounted for 61.9% of online views for homes in the 100 largest metros, which is a significant shift from the 48.6% seen in the pre-pandemic era of 2019. While this search activity is down modestly from last year's 64.7% peak, the long-term trend highlights a more mobile and interconnected pool of home shoppers.",
