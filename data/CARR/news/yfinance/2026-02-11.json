    "summary": "Carrier Global  stock has floundered since we recommended it, but there’s plenty of reason to believe in the business—and the stock.  The company may very well have understated the potential for residential recovery this year and it has strong long-term earnings potential.  Total organic revenue declined 9%, driven by yet another drop in residential sales, which have suffered from weak housing demand in the past few years.",
