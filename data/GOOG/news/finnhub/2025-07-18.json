Dori reveals that while only Tesla has officially disclosed bitcoin holdings, several of these firms have considered it as a way to diversify their corporate treasuries. He explains that the combination of rising shareholder interest, bitcoin’s fixed supply, and increasing regulatory clarity could make digital assets more attractive to cash-rich tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Dori also outlines why institutional investors are taking a renewed interest in bitcoin and ether. He points to bitcoin's scarcity-driven appeal as a hedge and store of value, while highlighting ether’s dual identity as both a yield-generating asset and foundational Web3 infrastructure. With institutional flows picking up and ETF access making crypto more approachable for traditional finance, Dori says we may be witnessing a pivotal shift in how leading firms think about digital assets, not just as speculative instruments, but as strategic financial tools.",
