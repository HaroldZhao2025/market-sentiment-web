VanCronkhite warns of investor \"complacency\" in 2025, particularly regarding the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. While acknowledging their \"tremendous\" returns, he cautions, \"That's a risk because the market is broadening out right now.\" He explains, \"We don't want to pay as much of a multiple for companies that are growing slower, which is the Mag Seven, compared to the broader market, which is the Russell 2000 (^RUT) and the Russell mid-cap stocks.\" VanCronkhite advises investors to be strategic. \"That doesn't mean sell it; it doesn't mean leave. Just be careful about staying too long. Rotate down,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. Regarding sector opportunities, VanCronkhite expresses caution about the banking sector, describing it as \"nerve-racking\" despite market optimism. Instead, he points to materials and healthcare as sectors with attractive valuations that could outperform in 2025.
