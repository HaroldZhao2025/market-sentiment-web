      "summary": "STORY: From who wins when robots race, to who loses when Cybertrucks go on patrol, this is Tech Weekly.++++The World Humanoid Robot Games came to a close in Beijing after three days of events.280 teams from 16 countries competed in everything from table tennis to track and field.Organizers said the games provided valuable data on developing robots for practical applications like factory work.++++Nvidia is developing a new AI chip for China, according to Reuters sources.It will be more powerful than the H20 model it’s currently allowed to sell there.The sources say first samples could get to clients next month, but they warn that U.S. approval isn’t assured, with Washington worried about giving China access to cutting-edge tech.++++AI firm Perplexity has made a $34.5 billion bid to buy Alphabet’s Chrome browser.That’s a sum far in excess of the startup's own valuation.Perplexity hopes the browser’s billions of users could give it a key advantage in the AI race, and it’s no stranger to ambitious bids.Earlier this year it offered to merge with TikTok. ++++Apple is bringing blood oxygen monitoring to many more of its watches.The tech will be available via a software update.It follows the end of a long legal dispute, which had seen the iPhone maker accused of stealing the technology for measuring blood oxygen.++++And Tesla Cybertrucks are on patrol with Mexican police.The electric vehicles are fitted with Starlink satellite internet - allowing them to search criminal databases even in the most remote areas.They’re also equipped with scanners to identify stolen vehicles, and can connect to the government’s video surveillance system.",
