The Magnificent 7 stocks are performing strongly again, even with chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report not due until May 28. This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.
