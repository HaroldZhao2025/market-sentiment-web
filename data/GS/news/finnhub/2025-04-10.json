    "summary": "HONG KONG (Reuters) -U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs lowered its forecasts for China's GDP growth to 4% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026 in a report published on Thursday, from 4.5% and 4.0% previously, citing the effects of tariffs.  Goldman Sachs made the revision for the world's No. 2 economy and second biggest provider of U.S. imports after U.S. President Donald Trump hiked the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level that kicked in on Wednesday.  Although additional tariff increases are likely to have a \"diminishing marginal impact\", the substantial rise in US tariffs on China is expected to significantly weigh on the Chinese economy and labor market, Goldman said.",
