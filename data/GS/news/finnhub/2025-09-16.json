    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley defeated appeals by investors who said the banks' market manipulation and insider trading fueled the March 2021 collapse of Archegos Capital Management, the $36 billion family office run by the since-convicted Bill Hwang.  In a 3-0 decision on Tuesday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Archegos was not an insider that owed fiduciary duties to companies whose stocks it owned.  This meant Archegos did not make Goldman and Morgan Stanley liable for allegedly front running the market by tipping them about its impending collapse, the court said.",
