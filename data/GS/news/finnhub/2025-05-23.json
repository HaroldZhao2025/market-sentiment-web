    "summary": "You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. One interesting call out from the latest earnings season is that big-time investments in AI continue despite signs the Trump administration’s tariff policy is weighing on the economy. Earnings results from AI leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) all indicated aggressive spending on AI projects to support demand from customers. You wouldn’t necessarily put Goldman Sachs in the camp of big AI spenders – but you would be wrong not to do so. The investment bank is investing in generative AI across the company to speed up things such as deal analysis to mundane back-office tasks. Leading the charge on AI at Goldman Sachs is former Amazon AWS exec Marco Argenti. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi welcomes Argenti to the Opening Bid roundtable to discuss the work being done on the AI front by one of the most prominent investment banks in the world. Argenti says AI will increasingly be embedded into the work of Goldman’s 46,000 employees as it strives for operational efficiencies. The question is, will it make life easier for often overworked junior investment bankers, or are these pet AI projects that may have little return? Sozzi and Argenti dive in! For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid is produced by Langston Sessoms",
