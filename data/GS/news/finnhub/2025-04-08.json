      "summary": "U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs said bond pricing inferred that markets believed there was 70% probability of a Ukraine peace deal, up sharply from before the November election of U.S. President Donald Trump.  \"Our modeling suggests that current market pricing for a peace deal has risen from below 50% prior to US elections to around 70% at present,\" Goldman Sachs said in research note to clients.  Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly said he wants to end the \"bloodbath\" of the three-year conflict in Ukraine - which his administration casts as a proxy war between the United States and Russia.",
