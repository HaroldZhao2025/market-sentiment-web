The increase in options prices underscores some of the challenges facing investors trading stocks that have been grinding higher, outside of rare plunges like Friday’s 2.7% drop after President Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs on China.  It was a reminder of the simmering concerns over the US government shutdown, the impact on corporate earnings from Trump’s economic policies and trade fights, and a potential bubble forming in artificial intelligence stocks.",
