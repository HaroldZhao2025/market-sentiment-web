But can the stock get its mojo back after Thanksgiving and Black Friday? That’s the bet Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh is making, adding the stock back to the top pick list. Parikh believes investors have gotten too bearish on Target’s longer-term prospects. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi breaks down the call in the video above.
