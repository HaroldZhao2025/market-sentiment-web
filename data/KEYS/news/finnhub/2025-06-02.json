    "summary": "(Reuters) -The U.S. government will require Keysight Technologies to divest three of Spirent Communications' businesses to resolve antitrust concerns before it buys the British company, a purchase originally valued at $1.5 billion.  In filings on Monday in the Washington, D.C., federal court, the U.S. Department of Justice said the divested assets include Spirent's high-speed ethernet testing, network security testing, and radio frequency channel emulation businesses.  Keysight said in March it planned to sell those businesses to Viavi Solutions, once known as JDS Uniphase, for as much as $425 million in cash.",
