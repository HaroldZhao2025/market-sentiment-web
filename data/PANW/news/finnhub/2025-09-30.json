    "summary": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israeli high-tech companies raised $11.9 billion over the first three quarters of 2025 as the technology sector continues to thrive despite Israel's two-year-old war against Hamas militants in Gaza.  At the same time, mergers and acquisitions reached a record $71 billion so far in 2025, nearly five times higher than the same period in 2024, and largely driven by Alphabet's $32 billion acquisition of cyber firm Wiz and Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion purchase of CyberArk.  The tech sector is a driver of Israel's economy, accounting for about 20% of GDP, 15% of jobs and more than 50% of exports.",
