The firm notes Q1 results were solid overall, highlighted by an acceleration in RPO growth given platformization momentum, alongside beats across other top- and bottom-line metrics. However, full-year RPO expectations were kept in line, while other metrics saw raises, effectively lowering bookings expectations and driving the disappointment on the quarter overall.",
