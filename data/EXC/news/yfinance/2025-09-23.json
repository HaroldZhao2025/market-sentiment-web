Exelon's effort comes as PJM Interconnection, the country's largest grid providing electricity to over 65 million people in the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic, faces supply shortfalls amid surging demand from data centers and the electrification of industries like transportation.  Chicago-based Exelon said in July that it was considering its options for building and owning regulated power generation, which electric utilities are legally barred from in about half of U.S. states.",
