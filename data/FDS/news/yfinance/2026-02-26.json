    "summary": "Nvidia  reported a 94% increase in profit and record sales for the fourth quarter, helping ease concerns over a possible artificial-intelligence bubble that rippled through markets in recent months.  Data center hardware—the chips and networking equipment that Nvidia sells to AI and cloud-computing companies—accounted for 91.4% of the quarter’s sales, or $62.3 billion, and the segment’s revenue grew slightly faster than the company’s overall sales.  “The simple way to think about it is, computing has changed,” Nvidia Chief Executive  Jensen Huang  said on Wednesday’s earnings call with investors.",
