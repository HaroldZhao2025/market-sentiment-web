        "summary": "Uber Technologies stock wavered early Wednesday after the ride-hail and food-delivery giant reported mixed fourth-quarter results and offered profit guidance below expectations.  Uber said that it earned 71 cents per share on an adjusted basis for the December-ended quarter, up 27% year-over-year but below the 85 cents per share that analysts polled by FactSet were forecasting.  Meanwhile, Uber's gross bookings grew 22% to $54.14 billion, ahead of estimates of $53.14 billion.",
