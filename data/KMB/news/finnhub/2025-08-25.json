The move is unusual for the Cincinnati-based consumer products maker, the biggest globally, because most of what it sells in the United States is manufactured domestically.  Target said earlier this year it would offer bumbum as part of an overhaul of its baby and toddler products, but did not identify the brand's manufacturer.",
