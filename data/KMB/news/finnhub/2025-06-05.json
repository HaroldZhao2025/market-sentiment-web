The consumer-products company is set to sell the division to  Suzano  the big pulp producer based in Brazil, the people said.  The sale of that business would dovetail with Kimberly-Clark’s efforts in 2024 to reorganize into three units, betting that a fresh structure would give it a competitive edge to boost profits and a lagging share price.",
