    "summary": "APPLETON, Wis.—Greg and Sara Cebulski enjoyed their years in Los Angeles, but when it came time to buy a bigger home for their family, they packed up and moved back to a place where they could actually afford one: the Midwest.  The couple, who grew up outside this quaint town in Wisconsin’s Fox River Valley, just closed on a 2,400-square-foot split level for $360,000—almost twice the size of the starter home they sold in the San Fernando Valley for more than twice that price.  Utilities, gasoline and dance and piano lessons for their two children are cheaper in Appleton, too.",
