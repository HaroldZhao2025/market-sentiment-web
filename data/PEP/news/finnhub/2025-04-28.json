    "summary": "PepsiCo's Gatorade unit on Monday won the dismissal of a lawsuit by former world champion sprinter Issam Asinga, who blamed his four-year doping ban on eating \"recovery gummies\" contaminated by a performance-enhancing drug.  U.S. District Judge Cathy Seibel in White Plains, New York, said Asinga, who is from Suriname, could not pursue strict liability and negligence claims because he did not allege that eating the gummies caused physical injury.  She also found no proof that Gatorade intentionally caused him to ingest a banned substance, thereby undermining his athletic scholarship from Texas A&M University and agreement to abide by world anti-doping rules.",
