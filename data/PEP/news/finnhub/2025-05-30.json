    "summary": "Buying a dividend stock when it's near its 52-week low means you have an opportunity to secure a higher-than-typical yield.  A falling share price pushes a yield up, and as long as the business' fundamentals are strong, you can benefit both from its recurring dividend payments and a possible rally in its share price in the future.  Three stocks that yield more than 4% and that are near their lows for the past year are PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), General Mills (NYSE: GIS), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX).",
