    "summary": "(Reuters) -PepsiCo won the dismissal of a lawsuit by a former executive who said the food and beverage company defrauded and defamed him by denying that he invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos.  In a decision on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge John Holcomb said Richard Montanez, who retired from PepsiCo in 2019 to become a full-time motivational speaker, did not show that PepsiCo and its Frito-Lay unit intentionally reneged on a promise to tell the \"true story\" of how he created the popular spicy chips.  The Santa Ana, California-based judge also said PepsiCo did not defame Montanez by allegedly refusing in 2023 to assist in a documentary about his life unless it debunked his claim.",
