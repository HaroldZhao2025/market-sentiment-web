    "summary": "This transaction strengthens our portfolio, cementing a third high-return foundational asset, diversing our production base and accelerating our free cash flow generation potential even during a more dynamic commodity environment.  For the third quarter 2025, oil, natural gas and NGL volumes exceeded the midpoints of our guidance, while capital expenditures, cash operating costs and DD&A all came in below guidance midpoints, resulting in $1.4 billion of free cash flow, $1.5 billion in net income and $1 billion of cash returned to shareholders through our regular dividend and share repurchases.  Through the first 3 quarters of this year, we have committed to return nearly 90% of our estimated 2025 free cash flow, including $2.2 billion in regular dividends and $1.8 billion of share repurchases.",
