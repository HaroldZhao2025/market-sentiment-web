    "summary": "(Reuters) -AbbVie said on Monday it would acquire privately held cell therapy developer Capstan Therapeutics in a deal worth up to $2.1 billion, expanding its product pipeline with experimental treatments for autoimmune diseases.  The U.S. drugmaker has spent over $20 billion on acquisitions since 2023 as its flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug, Humira, lost patent protection.  Capstan develops CAR-T therapies, which use a patient's own immune cells, specifically T-cells, to fight diseases.",
