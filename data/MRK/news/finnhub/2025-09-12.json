    "summary": "Britain's biggest company AstraZeneca has paused a planned 200 million pound ($271.26 million) investment in its Cambridge research site, a spokesperson said, the latest drugmaker to pull back on its business in Britain.  The decision on the investment, which had been set to create 1,000 jobs, means none of AstraZeneca's planned new funding - originally announced in March 2024 - is currently proceeding.  Asked about speculation over its pharmaceutical investments following Merck's announcement, a spokesperson for AstraZeneca confirmed the company had paused its investment plans in Cambridge, where it has one of Britain's leading life sciences hubs.",
