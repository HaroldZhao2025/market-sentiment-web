    "summary": "(Reuters) -Medtronic said on Tuesday it would add two new directors to its board and set up committees to help boost its lagging shares after activist investor Elliott Investment Management emerged as one of its largest shareholders.  The medical-device maker said veteran medtech executives John Groetelaars, once interim CEO for Dentsply Sirona, and Bill Jellison, formerly CFO at Stryker, would join its board as independent directors.  Medtronic also raised its full-year profit forecast for fiscal 2026 and said it expected a smaller hit of about $185 million from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, compared to the $200 million to $350 million it had previously expected.",
