Hot gift lists from retailers like ​Walmart feature a new crop of blind box figurines and trading cards, and U.S. companies including Hasbro and Mattel are selling versions of toys like Furby and Barbie in ‌mystery packaging, incorporating the trend.  A blind box toy – like Spin Master's popular CrystaLynx dragons – generally has packaging that hides the specific product inside so shoppers keep buying until they find the one they want or collect the whole ‌series.",
