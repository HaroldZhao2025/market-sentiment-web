    "headline": "Transformers versus Trump's tariffs: Hasbro CEO battles on",
    "summary": "The 2025 Toy Fair has come and gone from New York City. The annual event where toymakers show off their latest innovations for the year ahead saw several fun releases: Lego dropped a new Bluey set, Mattel (MAT) has gone all in on Masters of the Universe, and Hasbro (HAS) has released new interchangeable Nerf blasters. The event is set against the backdrop of tariffs from President Trump on China, which could hammer toymaker profits this year. So, how bad a hit are investors looking at here? Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks. The Street gave Hasbro high marks recently for aggressive cost-cutting, which has more room to go — the company aims to slash $1 billion in costs by 2027. Its previous goal was $750 million. But Trump's tariffs could reduce American consumers' spending power by $46 billion to $78 billion every year they are in place, estimates the National Retail Federation (NRF). Nearly 80% of US toys are manufactured in China, according to industry trade group the Toy Association. Cocks shares how Hasbro plans to navigate tariffs and a growing cautiousness among consumers.
