The results come when IT budgets remain ​tight and clients spend cautiously on large deals amid economic uncertainty, even though cybersecurity budgets face less pressure than general capital outlays. Zscaler provides cloud-based zero trust security, which is designed to eliminate the need for legacy firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs) ‌by authenticating each connection rather ⁠than granting broader network access.",
