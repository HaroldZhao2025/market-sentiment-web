    "summary": "Shares of semiconductor heavyweights Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ: MPWR) were rallying today, up 2.7%, 7.4%, and 6%, respectively, as of 2:21 p.m. ET.  The across-the-board gains were likely in response to reports the Trump administration may grant a reprieve from upcoming April 2 tariffs to semiconductors, as well as other \"strategic\" industrial sectors.  According to \"people familiar with the matter\" and reported first by Bloomberg, the Trump administration plans to omit the sector-specific tariffs it had been considering on automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, as part of the upcoming April 2 tariffs.",
