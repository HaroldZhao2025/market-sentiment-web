    "headline": "Media consolidation under the Trump admin: Analyst shares outlook",
    "summary": "Just days before the 2024 election, President Donald Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS, accusing the media giant of editing an interview with former Vice President and election rival Kamala Harris. While initially dismissed as a long shot, reports suggest that CBS-parent company Paramount Global (PARAA, PARA) is now considering a settlement to avoid interference in its merger with Skydance Media. MoffettNathanson senior analyst Robert Fishman joins Market Domination to explain that the challenges in linear TV — particularly with weak advertising and cord-cutting trends by viewers — will force media companies to consolidate. \"Clearly there's complications depending on which asset we're talking about or which company we're talking about. But, at the same time, these companies are going to be forced to go down that direction the more that the pressure builds,\" Fishman says. \"It's going to be the fundamentals that drive the decision, not just the need for consolidation for any other reason.\" Fishman also mentions that while industry fundamentals may drive consolidation, it may also be influenced by the current regulatory stances the Trump administration seems to be displaying.
