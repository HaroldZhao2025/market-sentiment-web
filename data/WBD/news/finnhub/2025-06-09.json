The breakup announced on Monday is the latest sign of the great unraveling of decades of media consolidation that have created global conglomerates spanning content creation, distribution and in some cases, telecommunications.  It unwinds WarnerMedia and Discovery's 2022 merger, giving the streaming and studios business more room to scale without being weighed down by the declining networks unit.",
