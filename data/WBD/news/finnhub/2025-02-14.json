    "summary": "The Super Bowl is in the books, with the Philadelphia Eagles delivering a commanding win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Companies paid a steep $8 million for a 30-second TV spot, up from $7 million in 2024. Now, sports and media watchers can return to their regularly scheduled programming. That programming is of high intrigue. For one, rights deals for Formula 1 and the UFC are on the table in 2025. The UFC alone could command a $1 billion a year deal, more than double the one it currently has with Disney-owned ESPN. Media watchers will be looking out for whether both sports end up on streaming channels amid the struggles at legacy media giants. In the meantime, the NFL can opt out of its rights deal with all media partners except for Disney after the 2028-2029 season. If they do opt out and head to a Netflix that is not hiding its appetite for live sports, it could alter the TV business forever. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi chats with longtime media executive David Levy about these tectonic shifts in the industry, especially on the sports front. Levy spent 32 years running Turner, leading its sports portfolio and even the Cartoon Network. Today, Levy is the founder and co-CEO of Horizon Sports & Experiences—which is making a bold bet on pickleball.
