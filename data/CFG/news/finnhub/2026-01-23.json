Citizens’ Q4 core EPS beat expectations on lighter provisioning, with underlying fundamentals remaining positive, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The results provide a strong foundation for Citizens to accelerate toward its 16%-18% medium-term ROTCE target, supported by persistent net interest margin tailwinds and emerging organic growth in 2026, the firm says",
