    "summary": "TD Cowen raised the firm’s price target on Citizens Financial (CFG) to $78 from $75 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Citizens’ Q4 core EPS beat expectations on lighter provisioning, with underlying fundamentals remaining positive, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The results provide a strong foundation for Citizens to accelerate toward its 16%-18% medium-term ROTCE target, supported by persistent net interest margin tailwinds and emerging organic growth in 2026, the firm says",
