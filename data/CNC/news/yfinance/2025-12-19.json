    "summary": "Health care premiums for more than 20 million Americans will, on average, more than double in 2026, which risks putting insurance out of reach for many voters already concerned about the costs of housing, groceries, utilities and other expenses.  When lawmakers return to the Capitol next month, they have less than two weeks to resolve the issue before open enrollment ends Jan. 15.  Amid fierce Republican infighting, Democrats are already declaring victory.",
