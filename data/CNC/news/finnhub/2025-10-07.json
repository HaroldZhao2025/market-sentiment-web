    "summary": "S&P 500 health care stocks including Centene and Molina Healthcare rose early Tuesday after President Donald Trump expressed openness to a deal with Democrats to avert the expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies.  While Trump said that Democrats must first agree to end the government shutdown, Wells Fargo analysts said they now assume the subsidies will survive.  If the subsidies aren't renewed, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the ranks of the uninsured will rise by 3.8 million.",
