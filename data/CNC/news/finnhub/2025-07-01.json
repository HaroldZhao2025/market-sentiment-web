Coming after industry bellwether UnitedHealth pulled its guidance for the year and replaced its CEO, the move is likely to add to investors’ nervousness about the entire insurance sector, which has been feeling the effect of higher-than-expected medical costs.  Humana and CVS Health’s Aetna struggled last year, with CVS also bringing on a new chief executive.",
