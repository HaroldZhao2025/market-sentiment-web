    "summary": "Shares of Dollar General (NYSE: DG) were moving lower today, even though there was no company-specific news out on the discount retailer.  Instead, the move seemed to come in response to disappointing results from Target (NYSE: TGT) this morning, which seemed to confirm that Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which reported earnings yesterday, is continuing to gobble up market share from competitors like Target and Dollar General.  As of 1:19 p.m. ET, Dollar General stock was down 4.5%.",
