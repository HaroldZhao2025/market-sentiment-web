    "summary": "The Russell 2000 Index, home to some of the riskiest stocks in the market because of their strong ties to the business and credit cycles, just ended the longest run of beating large caps since 1996.  The bet is predicated on expectations for faster earnings growth, owing to a combination of falling interest rates and economic growth.  “This channel of strong enough growth – but not too strong – and lower or declining rates are two big macro forces that can push small caps higher,” said Sebastien Page, chief investment officer at T Rowe Price, which manages nearly $1.8 trillion.",
