The bet is predicated on expectations for faster earnings growth, owing to a combination of falling interest rates and economic growth.  “This channel of strong enough growth – but not too strong – and lower or declining rates are two big macro forces that can push small caps higher,” said Sebastien Page, chief investment officer at T Rowe Price, which manages nearly $1.8 trillion.",
