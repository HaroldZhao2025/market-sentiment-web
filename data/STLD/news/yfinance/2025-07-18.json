    "summary": "Top U.S. steelmakers' second-quarter fortunes are likely to be a mixed bag, caught between a fillip from higher steel prices and uneven demand amid uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. In its mid-quarter update, Nucor forecast second-quarter profit ahead of analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG, citing higher average selling prices across its steelmaking segments, especially sheet and plate mills that produce flat-rolled products used in construction, automotive, manufacturing, agriculture and energy sectors. Nucor's higher shipments and steady pricing could be attributed to a \"more diverse footprint,\" J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note.",
