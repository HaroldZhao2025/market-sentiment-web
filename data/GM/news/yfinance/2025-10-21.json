    "summary": "Six months after pulling its full-year forecast over uncertainty about the Trump administration’s tariffs, GM said Tuesday it now expects to make $12 billion to $13 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in 2025 — up from a previous range of $10 billion to $12.5 billion it had affirmed in July.  The improved outlook comes as GM is seeing a jump in sales of high-margin, gas-powered SUVs and trucks partly enabled by moves to ease federal emissions rules.  In a letter to shareholders and on a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra thanked President Donald Trump for extending through 2030 a tariff discount on some imports for carmakers that produce and sell completed automobiles in the US.",
