UnitedHealth Group tumbled 19.5% even though it reported a profit for the latest quarter that was a bit better than analysts expected.  More attention was on the company’s forecast for revenue in the upcoming year, which fell short of Wall Street’s expectations and could be weaker than it was in 2025.",
