    "summary": "General Motors (GM) is racing into Formula 1. Recently it was announced the automotive company is joining F1 in 2026 under the Cadillac brand, bringing the racing league to 11 teams. This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano takes a deeper look into GM and Cadillac’s involvement in the sport, and why this relationship is so important for the luxury brand. From Formula 1’s perspective, they want to grow their American audience according to Pompliano. “This is why they now have three races in America after not having a single one more than a decade ago,” Pompliano says. For GM and Cadillac, they want the exposure with the hopes of leading to more profit. Pompliano says, “The American car brand sells about 400,000 cars annually, but most of those sales come through America and Canada, and now they want to expand those sales into more F1 minded countries throughout Europe and Asia.” To hear more, check out this week’s episode of Yahoo Finance Sports report here.
