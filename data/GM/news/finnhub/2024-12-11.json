    "summary": "Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares climb to a record high after Google announced its latest AI model, Gemini 2.0. The update comes after Google unveiled a new quantum computing chip, Willow, which sent the stock higher. Seaport Research Partners senior analyst Aaron Kessler joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to break down the news and the stock move. \"I think it shows that Google continues to be the leader in AI services. Obviously, Google's been investing in AI for several years now, and it was one of the early leaders. Obviously, I think there was concern with OpenAI maybe jumping Google in terms of ChatGPT, but I think Google's had a nice rebound here with tools like Gemini.\" The analyst says \"it's probably a few things\" driving the stock to record highs, including Gemini 2.0. and the quantum computing chip announcment, as well as General Motors (GM) shutting down its robotaxi unit, eliminating a possible competitor to Alphabet-owned Waymo. He adds, \"Maybe investors are saying with the new administration coming in less likely, maybe, we see some DOJ action in terms of really splitting up Google and Chrome, which we think is pretty unlikely.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

GM on Tuesday said it plans to realign its autonomous driving strategy and give priority to development of advanced driver assistance systems, which take over steering and other functions in certain situations and are common on new vehicles today.  The automaker said it would continue to develop fully autonomous technology for personal vehicles, and build on the progress of its Super Cruise system, a hands-off, eyes-on driving feature that the company introduced several years ago.",
