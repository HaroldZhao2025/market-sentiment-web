    "summary": "After US President Donald Trump backed off on doubling tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, iSeeCars.com executive analyst Karl Brauer joins Asking for a Trend with Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of tariff uncertainty on automakers. Brauer tells Yahoo Finance while it is \"possible\" for automakers to make their cars entirely in the US, it wouldn't be \"easy\": \"The problem isn't making them here. The problem is the transition to making them here.\" The analyst says that the difference between the long time it takes automakers to make that transition compared to the speed in which politicians can enact policies, like tariffs, is a source of frustration for the auto industry. Watch the video above to hear from the analyst about changes automakers can make, uncertainty under Trump policies, and more.
