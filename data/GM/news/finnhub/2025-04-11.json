GM Canada said the decision to halt production at the CAMI Assembly through most of the spring and summer is related to market demand and high inventory for the BrightDrop vehicle — and not because of the tariffs the United States has imposed on Canadian vehicle production.  Company spokesperson Jennifer Wright said in a statement that GM Canada is making “operational and employment adjustments to balance inventory and align production schedules with current demand.”",
