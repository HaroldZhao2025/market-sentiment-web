      "summary": "Morning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Madison Mills highlight three stories to watch for. President Trump's push for a 25% tariff on autos is sending shockwaves through the European and American auto industries, with European stocks falling and automakers like Mercedes-Benz (MBGYY) facing potential major losses. American car stocks are mixed today, with General Motors (GM) and Ford (FORD) lower while Tesla (TSLA) trades higher. Additionally, President Trump threatens larger tariffs on the EU and Canada, and US stock futures (ES=F, NQ=F, YM=F) point to a lower open as investors digest the news of Trump's tariffs.
