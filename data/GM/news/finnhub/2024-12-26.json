    "summary": "Electric vehicles and trucks will be the focus of the US auto market in 2025, iSeeCars.com executive analyst Karl Brauer tells Brad Smith and Josh Lipton on Market Domination. The analyst takes a closer look at what to expect from the auto market in 2025 and what it means for investors. The EV market is expected to be challenged in the new year with President-elect Trump returning to the White House and ongoing slow consumer demand. \"A lot of these companies are starting to already shift their EV product kind of into [a back-up] plan and moving forward with more internal combustion and hybrid vehicles, which is, I think, smart,\" Brauer says. The analyst highlights Toyota (TM) as a standout automaker in the hybrid space. Another challenge for the electric transition is that the US is \"a truck country,\" Brauer says, adding, \"It's going to be tough to ever really kill those truck sales [since] there's just so many uses for them here both commercially and privately.\" He says that Ram hybrid truck offerings, made by Stellantis (STLA), are \"brilliant\" since they provide consumers with an electrified truck option while easing range anxiety with an internal combustion engine. He adds, \"We're going to watch how quickly the other full-sized truck makers, GM (GM) and Ford (F), struggle to catch up.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.
