    "headline": "NFL’s holiday ratings boost, GM races into F1: YF Sports Report",
    "summary": "NFL football games taking place on Thanksgiving Day is a tradition dating back to 1920 when the league was founded. This year’s three NFL broadcasts continued the infamous tradition, but were unique in their own regard by sharing a commonality: they rated big. On this week’s episode of Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano analyzes the ratings from the NFL’s 2024 Thanksgiving Day games, specifically the Dallas Cowboys versus the New York Giants, and explains what was so particular about this match. The Cowboys vs. Giants game, which aired on Fox (FOX), averaged 38.5 million viewers during the broadcast. This is projected to rank as the most-watched NFL telecast this season, according to Fox Sports PR. What makes this so unique is the game itself was that “It was two of the worst starting quarterbacks [playing] in the league today,” Pompliano says. “Both backup quarterbacks for the Giants and Cowboys with Drew Lock and Cooper Rush played and the game wasn’t very exciting.” Even the Miami Dolphins and Green Bay Packers game had high viewership with 26.6 million, according to NBC Sports PR. Later on in the show, Pompliano breaks down the significance of General Motors (GM) joining F1 and Bluestone Equity Group Managing Partner Bobby Sharma, joins the show to discuss investing in sports. Yahoo Finance Sports Report with Joe Pompliano, a vodcast brought to you by Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports, looks beyond the latest sports business headlines, analyzes all the need-to-know news - the teams, trades, and billion dollar deals - so you and your portfolio will win BIG.
