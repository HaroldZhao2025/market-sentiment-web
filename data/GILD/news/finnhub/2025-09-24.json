    "summary": "(Reuters) -Indian drugmakers Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Hetero Labs said on Wednesday that they will sell generic versions of a new and highly effective HIV prevention drug for roughly $40 per year beginning in 2027.  Lenacapavir, developed by Gilead Sciences and approved earlier this year for HIV prevention under the brand name Yeztugo, is a twice-yearly injection that was nearly 100% effective at preventing HIV in large trials.  Some AIDS experts, including activists and doctors, say it could help control the 44-year-long epidemic that still infects 1.3 million people a year, and which the World Health Organization estimates has killed 44 million.",
