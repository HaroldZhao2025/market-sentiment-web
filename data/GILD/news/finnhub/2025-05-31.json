    "summary": "(Reuters) -Gilead Sciences' Trodelvy in combination with Merck's blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda lowered the risk of an aggressive type of breast cancer worsening by 35% when used as an initial treatment, according to results of a large trial presented on Saturday.  The data is likely to change how patients are treated following a diagnosis for advanced triple-negative breast cancer, one expert said.  After a median follow-up of 14 months, patients treated with Trodelvy, a so-called antibody-drug conjugate, and Keytruda went 11.2 months without their cancer progressing, a measure known as progress-free survival.",
