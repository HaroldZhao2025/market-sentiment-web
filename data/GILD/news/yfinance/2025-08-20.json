CVS based the decision on clinical, financial, and regulatory factors, spokesperson David Whitrap said in an email.  It also will not cover Yeztugo under its Affordable Care Act formularies, since its ACA preventive program follows recommendations and mandates from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Whitrap said.",
