        "summary": "Shares of specialty chemical company  Johnson Matthey  plunged at the start of a new week of trading after investors realized it would not receive as much as expected from an asset sale.  Honeywell  is on the other side of the transaction, so Johnson’s loss is their win.  The changes in value don’t exactly line up, however, which tells investors something about the stock market.",
