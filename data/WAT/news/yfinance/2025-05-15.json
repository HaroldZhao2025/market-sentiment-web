Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and diabetes medicine Ozempic, goes off patent in India in 2026, paving the way for cheaper versions of the drugs.  Local drugmakers including Biocon, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's and Lupin have been racing to make generic versions of these drugs to grab a share of the global market estimated to be worth $150 billion in the next decade.",
