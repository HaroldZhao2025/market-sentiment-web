    "summary": "WASHINGTON—Amid a MAGA-led backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion policies, the Supreme Court signaled it would rule that white people and members of other majority groups who file reverse-discrimination lawsuits shouldn’t face tougher legal scrutiny than Black and other minority employees with bias claims.  Wednesday’s case came from Ohio, where  Marlean Ames  claims the state agency where she works denied her a promotion and then demoted her because she is heterosexual, instead giving both her old job and the one she had sought to gay people.  A federal appeals court in Cincinnati threw out Ames’s lawsuit, finding that she failed to show the “background circumstances” suggesting the employer was hostile to straight people—a threshold step that wouldn’t have been required had a gay employee claimed discrimination.",
