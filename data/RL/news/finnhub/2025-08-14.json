    "summary": "LONDON (Reuters) -Well-heeled shoppers around the United States seem - so far at least - willing to soak up price hikes for aspirational products from trendy Birkenstock sandals to Bugaboo prams, despite the impact of trade tariffs and belt-tightening elsewhere.  German sandal and clog brand Birkenstock has enjoyed strong consumer demand with little pushback from U.S. retailers since hiking prices at the start of July, its chief executive said on Thursday.  Comments from Birkenstock, Bugaboo, Coach, Ralph Lauren and other brands at the premium end of the market suggest that, so far, affluent consumers are shrugging off price hikes.",
