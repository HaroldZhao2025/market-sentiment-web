    "summary": "During the last few weeks of the year, trading volume on Wall Street is typically light as investors celebrate the holidays and take vacations.  In the last few weeks, Buffett and his team piled into a classic internet stock that is up by more than 3,000% since its initial public offering in 1998.  In a market where everyone seems to be buying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that are trading at high multiples, Buffett and Berkshire have remained disciplined, sticking to their classic playbook of avoiding the froth and looking for value in beaten-down names or buying wonderful companies trading at fair prices.",
