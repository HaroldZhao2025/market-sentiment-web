VeriSign's recent resurgence shone a light on its business, which as ever remains protected by a strong economic moat (a favorite concept of Buffett's) and is performing accordingly.  Buy-and-hold investors who had the foresight to take a position in VeriSign just after its 1998 initial public offering (IPO) would own considerably more shares these days.",
