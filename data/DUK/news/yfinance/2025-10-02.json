The 750-MW combined-cycle natural gas plant powers up to 600,000 homes using high-efficiency technology that captures exhaust heat to generate additional electricity. The company’s newly proposed 1,400-MW hydrogen-capable combined-cycle plant—announced in June 2025 for a site in the same county—will mark Duke Energy’s first new generation project request in South Carolina in over a decade.
