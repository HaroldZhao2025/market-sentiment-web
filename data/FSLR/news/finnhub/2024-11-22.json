    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has picked Liberty Energy (LBRT) CEO Chris Wright as his pick for secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE). Wright also sits on the board of nuclear energy provider Oklo Inc. (OKLO). William Blair group head of energy and sustainability research sector Jed Dorsheimer joins Julie Hyman and Madison Mills on Market Domination Overtime to discuss what stocks within the energy sector benefit the most from a second Trump administration. Wright is \"a fantastic pick [for DOE secretary] in terms of GE Vernova (GEV),\" Dorsheimer says, adding that the company is \"the world's leader\" in energy in terms of its market share making natural gas turbines and switchgear substations. Watch the video above for Dorsheimer's perspective on Trump-era energy policies, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, how Trump's proposed Department of Government Efficiency Commission (DOGE), co-led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy could affect the future of nuclear energy, and more.
