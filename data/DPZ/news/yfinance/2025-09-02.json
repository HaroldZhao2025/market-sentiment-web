Starting Sept. 8, McDonald’s will offer Extra Value Meals, which combine select entrées like a Big Mac, an Egg McMuffin or a McCrispy sandwich with medium fries or hash browns and a drink.  Prices will vary by location, but McDonald’s said Extra Value Meals will cost 15% less than ordering each of those items separately.",
