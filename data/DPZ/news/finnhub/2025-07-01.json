    "summary": "(Reuters) -Domino's Pizza Enterprises said on Wednesday its CEO and managing director, Mark van Dyck, would step down before Christmas this year, sending the Australian franchise operator's shares plummeting about 16% to their weakest in over 11 years.  Van Dyck, a former Coca-Cola executive, took over from the franchise operator's longstanding head, Don Meij, in November last year as the company struggled to maintain sales in a post-COVID era.  In eight months, Van Dyck laid the groundwork for a turnaround, closing low-volume stores and initiating cost-saving measures.",
