    "summary": "Warren Buffett reportedly manages about 90% of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) equity securities portfolio, while understudies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler handle the rest.  The company does not disclose which investment manager makes each individual trade, but Buffett is almost certainly in charge of large positions like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).  Despite once calling Apple the \"best business\" in the world, Buffett sold 100 million shares in the third quarter, cutting Berkshire's stake by 25%.",
