The stock fell 9% ‌in premarket trading and was on track to widen losses of about 40% this year triggered by worries that ​growing use of artificial intelligence tools launched by the likes of Anthropic would erode demand for traditional software.  The losses mean Workday is one of the worst-performing U.S. software stocks this year.",
