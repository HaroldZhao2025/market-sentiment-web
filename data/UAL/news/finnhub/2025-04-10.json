    "summary": "Shares in United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) were down as much as 11.4% today due to market volatility and investors digesting Delta Air Lines' (NYSE: DAL) earnings report and commentary the day before.  United Airlines will report its first-quarter 2025 earnings on April 16, and if Delta's earnings are any indication, United's management is highly likely to report deteriorating conditions.  For example, in early March, Delta Air Lines management told investors that its first-quarter revenue growth would come in closer to 4% compared to previous guidance for growth of 7% to 9%.",
