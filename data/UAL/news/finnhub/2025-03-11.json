This follows a similar announcement from United Airlines (UAL), which also reported a drop in travel demand. Citi managing director Stephen Trent joins Morning Brief hosts Madison Mills and Brad Smith to share his insights on the situation. \"In terms of the long-term outlook, there is not a great deal of impetus to go and make big moves in any investment cases for this group,\" Trent says. Trent also highlights the significant external factors affecting the airline industry, such as aviation accidents and natural phenomena like wildfires. Despite the current challenges, he believes the airline industry has the potential for adjustment, adding, \"Can we see some pivots in capacity over the next several months?
