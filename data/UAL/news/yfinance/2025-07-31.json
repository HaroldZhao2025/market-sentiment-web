Transatlantic connections are among the most lucrative for airlines, having bolstered British Airways-owner IAG in recent years as European competitors struggled. A number of U.S. airlines, including Delta, abandoned their full-year financial forecasts this spring on the back of weakening travel demand after U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs dented business and consumer confidence.",
