    "summary": "After years of lagging the major US equities benchmarks, the Dow Jones Transportation Average is in the lead, outperforming the S&P 500 Index by 13 percentage points in the past month and a half, near the most since the financial crisis.  The gauge — which contains industry stalwarts such as CSX Corp., FedEx Corp. and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc., and even United Airlines Holdings Inc. — has been catapulted higher by strong data and a pivot away from the big tech winners of the last few years.  Following last week’s readout from the Institute for Supply Management which showed manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace since 2022 in January, the transportation gauge notched another all-time closing high.",
