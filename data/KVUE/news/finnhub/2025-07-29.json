At least 41 CEOs have exited S&P 500 companies so far this year, compared with 49 for all of 2024 – making the fastest pace on an annualized basis since 2005, according to data from nonprofit executive research group The Conference Board and data analytics company ESGAUGE.  In the latest example, consumer goods company Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide laundry detergent and Bounty paper towels, said on Monday CEO Jon Moeller will be replaced next year by longtime executive Shailesh Jejurikar.",
