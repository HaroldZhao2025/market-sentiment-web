    "summary": "President-elect  Donald Trump  on Wednesday picked conservative lawyer  Paul Atkins  to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, choosing a regulatory skeptic who will be expected to cut red tape and rein in the agency’s enforcement division.  Atkins, well known in Congress and on Wall Street, served as a Republican member of the SEC during the Bush administration, when he sometimes opposed regulations he argued were unnecessarily burdensome.  If confirmed as the next SEC chair, Atkins isn’t expected to dismantle core investor protections, but is likely to re-examine or revise much of what the agency did during the Biden administration.",
