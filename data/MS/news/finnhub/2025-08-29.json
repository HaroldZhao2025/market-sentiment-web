The central bank added that the new capital requirements, which take effect on Oct. 1, would be updated should the Fed adopt a proposal to average the results of two years of stress tests.  Under the annual stress test of large bank finances, the Fed examines how banks would perform under a hypothetical economic downturn, and sets their capital cushions in line with how severe their losses would be.",
