    "summary": "TOKYO (Reuters) -Morgan Stanley is raising about 100 billion yen ($684 million) for a Japan-focused real estate fund, two people familiar with the matter said, highlighting investor interest in property as the world's fourth-largest economy emerges from years of deflation and standstill prices.  The Morgan Stanley-managed fund is due to close in June and expected to raise at least 100 billion yen based on current investor commitments, according to the people, both of whom declined to be identified because the information hasn't been made public.  Investment will centre on offices and multi-family residential buildings in major cities, as well as logistics and hotels, one of the people said.",
