The Congressional Budget Office expects the legislation to add $5 trillion to overall U.S. debt by 2034.  S&P Global Ratings  said revenue from President Donald Trump’s tariff program likely would offset some of the deficit increases from his tax and spending bill, allowing it to maintain an AA+ credit rating for the world’s biggest economy.",
