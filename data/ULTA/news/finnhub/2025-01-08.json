    "summary": "Shares of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) were climbing higher last month after the beauty superstore chain posted better-than-expected results in its third-quarter earnings report, showing improvement on the bottom line, and that the worst of its market-share losses seemed to be behind it. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished the month up 13%.  As you can see from the chart, the stock jumped early in the month on the earnings report and managed to add on gains later in the month, even as the broad market pulled back.  Ulta's third-quarter earnings report wasn't exactly stellar, but showed the company moving past previous challenges and doing a better job of managing costs.",
