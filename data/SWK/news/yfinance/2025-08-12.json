    "summary": "A number of stocks jumped in the morning session after an in-line inflation report fueled hopes for interest rate cuts and the U.S. and China agreed to extend their tariff truce. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, came in largely as expected, holding steady at 2.7% year-over-year. This reading boosted investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will have room to lower interest rates at its next meeting, which could reduce borrowing costs for companies and consumers.",
