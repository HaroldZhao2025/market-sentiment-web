    "summary": "The tariffs imposed by the current administration are hurting Stanley Black & Decker's near-term outlook.  The Liberation Day tariffs President Trump announced at the start of the month are significantly affecting its business, and management promptly lowered its full-year guidance on its first-quarter earnings presentation at the end of the month.  Management estimates the tariffs imposed in April, which came on top of previously announced tariffs, will result in a negative $0.75 impact on earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, reducing its full-year guidance accordingly.",
