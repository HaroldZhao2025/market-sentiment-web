    "summary": "Shares in Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) were down by about 12% at noon ET today.  The company took a major hit in costs the last time President Trump was in office, and it looks like a similar thing will happen this time.  For example, management said a 10% tariff rate on China would result in a \"net impact of $10 million to $20 million\" in 2025 for the company.",
