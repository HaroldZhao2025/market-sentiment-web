    "summary": "Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) declined by more than 11% in trading at noon ET today.  Aside from its obvious exposure to any tariff-induced decline in the economy (significant, as discretionary spending on DIY tools and industrial fasteners gets cut in a slowdown), Stanley Black & Decker has specific exposure from sourcing products from countries like China.  Management discussed the issue on an earnings call before President Trump's election victory in late October.",
