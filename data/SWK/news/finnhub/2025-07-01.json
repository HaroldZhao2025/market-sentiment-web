    "summary": "The latest executive hire by Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) continued to be well received on Tuesday, a day after it was announced.  This was bolstered by an analyst's price target rise, although that pundit left his rather lukewarm recommendation intact.  Stanley Black & Decker's shares ended the day almost 4% higher in price, essentially obliterating the S&P 500 index with its 0.1% decline.",
