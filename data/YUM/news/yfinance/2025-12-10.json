But the side dish is that they’re quite difficult to operate because high inventory and labor costs generally lead to thin margins at the store level. This leaves little room for error if demand dries up, and it seems like the market has some reservations as the industry has tumbled by 14% over the past six months. This performance is a noticeable divergence from the S&P 500’s 13.4% return.",
