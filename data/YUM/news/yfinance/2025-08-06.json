    "headline": "McDonald's global sales top estimates as affordable meal options boost demand",
    "summary": "(Reuters) -McDonald's second-quarter global comparable sales beat Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, as affordable meal bundles and promotions drew in budget-conscious diners looking to stretch their dollars amid economic uncertainty.  Its shares rose 2.3% in early trading as strong demand in the U.S. and international markets powered a 3.8% rise in global same-store sales, above expectations of a 2.4% rise, according to data compiled by LSEG.  Fast-food chains have seen competition heat up as companies such as McDonald's, Domino's Pizza and Taco Bell owner Yum Brands double down on value meals to counter a slowdown in demand, mainly among the lower-income households.",
