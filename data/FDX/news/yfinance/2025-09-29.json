Investors are keen for information on the holiday delivery season that stretches from Thanksgiving to Christmas because companies like FedEx and UPS can deliver twice the normal number of packages on some days.  The expected increase in holiday deliveries will not be spread equally across companies, logistics technology provider ShipMatrix said on Monday.",
