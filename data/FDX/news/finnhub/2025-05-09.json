    "summary": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Postal Service Board on Friday said it named David Steiner, a FedEx board member and former CEO of Waste Management, as the new postmaster general after the White House pressured the prior leader to resign in March.  Postal unions have raised sharp concerns about Steiner's selection to succeed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy because he sits on the board of a competitor to the Postal Service.  The Postal Service reported a wider net loss of $3.3 billion for the three months ending March 31 as it  continues to hike stamp prices and seek ways to cut costs.",
