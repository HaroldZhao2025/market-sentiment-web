Wedbush Securities managing director of equity research for retail hardlines Seth Basham joins Catalysts to discuss how retailers will absorb tariff-fueled price increases, noting that most retailers will be forced to pass on some of the cost to their consumers. Basham notes that retailers with more pricing power, such as auto parts retailers and mass merchants that sell consumer staples, will be more equipped to withstand the impact of these tariffs.
