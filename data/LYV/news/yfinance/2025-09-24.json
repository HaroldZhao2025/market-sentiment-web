    "summary": "Live Nation  the parent of Ticketmaster, dominates live-event ticketing—controlling more than 80% of the primary market and moving tens of millions of tickets a year.  It is trying to turn new ticket regulations, set to be recommended by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission this week, into a new weapon against consumers and its business rivals.  It is urging Washington to impose a 20% price cap on ticket resales, arguing that would curb price gouging on the secondary market.",
