    "summary": "After a long pause, it looks as though the market for initial public offerings (IPOs) may be heating up again.  One interesting prospective IPO is StubHub, which filed an S-1 registration form recently and plans to sell shares soon on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker symbol STUB.  The story includes a founder returning to lead a company from which he had previously been fired (Steve Jobs, anyone?), 30% growth in each of the past two years, and a new growth opportunity that management is only beginning to cultivate.",
