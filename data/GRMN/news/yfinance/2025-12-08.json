    "summary": "Opening Bid Unfiltered is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The battle to analyze your health data has arguably never been fiercer. The Apple (AAPL) Watch has sold tens of millions of units, all of which are collecting health data. Whoop is eyeing an IPO. Not to mention, there are an array of other major players in the wearables space, such as Samsung (005930.KS) and Garmin (GRMN). Does there need to be one winner, though, as the longevity industry continues to grow in size? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Oura Health CEO Tom Hale. Oura — the maker of the popular health tracking ring — is fresh off raising $900 million from a series of investors. The proceeds are being earmarked for international expansion, and perhaps a foray into payments. Hale shares his ultimate vision for Oura Health, what he has learned about leadership three years into being CEO, and the dos and don'ts of health tracking.
