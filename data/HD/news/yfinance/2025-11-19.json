    "headline": "Lowe's Profits Top Estimates as TJX Raises Outlook",
    "summary": "Lowe's Cos. reported profit that topped expectations on a pickup in online sales and growth in demand from professional contractors. The results mark a minor bright spot in retailer results this week after competitor Home Depot cut its full-year profit target on Tuesday as consumers pulled back on bigger ticket purchases. Elsewhere, TJX Cos., which runs chains including TJ Maxx and Marshalls, posted sales above estimates last quarter, raising its outlook, and perhaps signaling that US shoppers are turning to cheaper options as the economy shows signs of stress. Bloomberg's Redd Brown and Lily Meier joined Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on 'Bloomberg Businessweek Daily' to break it all down.",
