    "summary": "Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) are the two largest home improvement retailers in America.  Both of their stocks slumped in 2022 and 2023 as inflation curbed consumer discretionary spending and rising interest rates chilled the housing market, but they both have rallied by about 20% so far this year as the macro environment has stabilized.  Should investors buy either of these stocks before interest rates decline further and the housing market heats up again?",
