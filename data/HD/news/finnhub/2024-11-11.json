We're looking for basically in-line results for the third quarter and [a] reiteration of the full-year guidance. That being said, I think the company can point to some green shoots that will positively impact its business into 2025, and those really revolve around what's happening with housing.

But as it relates to tariffs, that's the biggest headwind. 60% tariffs on products coming out of China would be a material negative for Home Depot.\" Watch the video above for more on Basham's perspective on what a second Trump term means for Home Depot, the connection between the company's result and the housing market, and more.
