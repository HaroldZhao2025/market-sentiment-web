Containerized imports to the Port of Los Angeles, the nation's busiest and a bellwether for U.S. trade, jumped 8% to 544,000 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in July from the same month of 2024.  \"Much of this volume was fueled by importers hustling to bring in cargo ahead of potential tariff hikes later this month and beyond,\" Gene Seroka, the port's executive director, said on Wednesday.",
