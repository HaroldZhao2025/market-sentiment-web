After being powered by the artificial-intelligence trade all year, stocks don’t seem to know where to head this month—traditionally one of the market’s strongest—thanks to data showing solid gains in some corners of the world’s biggest economy, and ongoing weakness in others.  Lower Fed interest rates would almost surely support market valuations over the months ahead.",
