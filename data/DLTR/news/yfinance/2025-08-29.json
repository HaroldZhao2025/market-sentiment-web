Markets will be closed on Monday, Sept. 1 for Labor Day. After that, a fresh batch of quarterly earnings results are on tap: Tuesday earnings: Nio (NIO), Signet Jewelers (SIG), Academy Sports (ASO), Zscaler (ZS) Wednesday earnings: Dollar Tree (DLTR), Campbell's (CPB), Macy's (M), Salesforce (CRM), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) Thursday earnings: Toro Company (TTC), Broadcom (AVGO), lululemon (LULU), DocuSign (DOCU), ServiceTitan (TTAN), UiPath (PATH) On Friday morning, the August Jobs Report will be published, potentially influencing the Federal Reserve's decision whether to cut interest rates later in September. Economists are expecting 75,000 jobs to have been added in August, a slight increase from the 73,000 added in July. On Thursday, White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman Stephen Miran will attend his Senate Banking nomination hearing, which will determine whether he is sworn in as Federal Reserve governor to replace Adriana Kugler.
