The company had said in May it would take steps such as restructuring and reduced capital and engineering spending to cushion the hit from sweeping tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump's levies have pressured auto companies across the supply chain, forcing suppliers to absorb more expenses or renegotiate with automakers.",
