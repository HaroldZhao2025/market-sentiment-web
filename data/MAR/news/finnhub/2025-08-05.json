      "summary": "American consumers have been cutting back on discretionary expenses, including travel, after U.S. President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policies and the resulting trade war sparked fears of a recession.  Total second-quarter room revenue in the U.S. and Canada was flat compared with the year earlier, as the impact from the travel slowdown was offset by strength in the company's upscale properties in the region.  Marriott's upscale segments, which include brands such as the Ritz-Carlton and Sheraton, cater to more economically resilient customers, helping to cushion the impact of slowing demand in its budget and select-service offerings.",
