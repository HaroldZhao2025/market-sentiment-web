Once viewed primarily as a designer of chips used to help video game graphics, the company's graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, given their superior processing speed and energy efficiency compared to the central processing units (CPUs) found in computers and smartphones.  CUDA became the standard on which developers learned to program GPUs, and that, in turn, has helped make Nvidia GPUs the most desirable today.",
