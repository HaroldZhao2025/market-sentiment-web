In an emergency directive issued Thursday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said government cyber workers had just over one day to account for all such devices plugged into their networks, scan them for malicious activity, and apply relevant software updates intended to patch the vulnerability.  The affected equipment included a subset of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series devices, which work as firewalls protecting corporate networks from hackers.",
