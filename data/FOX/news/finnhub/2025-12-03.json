Combined with the other Thanksgiving games—Fox’s coverage of the Green Bay Packers defeating the Detroit Lions and NBC’s broadcast of the Cincinnati Bengals toppling the Baltimore Ravens—about 133.3 million people spent a large part of last Thursday watching football.  Thanksgiving NFL games always draw strong audiences, but this year’s lineup was a reminder of the power of the league to draw big numbers in an increasingly fragmented media landscape.",
