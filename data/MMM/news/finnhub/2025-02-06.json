    "summary": "The move comes as the market continues to warm to CEO Bill Brown's plans to rejuvenate the company's long-term growth rate and improve its operational performance.  3M isn't getting much help from its end markets, but its ongoing restructuring is expanding profit margins, and there's a lot of potential for future improvement.  3M's end markets remain mixed with weakness in auto builds and consumer discretionary spending, balanced by improving consumer electronics and aerospace end markets.",
