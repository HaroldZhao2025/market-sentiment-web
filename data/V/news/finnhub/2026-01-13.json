The markets got attuned to consecutive Fed cuts the last three meetings. And the thought was maybe, just maybe, if CPI is a lot cooler than expected, maybe they'll give the Fed some license to cut again. Clearly, the CPI print was cooler, but still elevated. And so I think there's a realization in the market today that the Fed's not going to be cutting anytime soon.”Other stocks on the move included Adobe which fell about five and a half percent after broker Oppenheimer lowered its rating on the shares to perform from outperform on slowing digital media growth.And Boeing rose two percent after posting its highest annual plane deliveries since 2018.",
