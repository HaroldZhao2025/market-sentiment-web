U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan said it was unreasonable for consumers to consider gift cards impervious to scams, or that Visa's logo amounted to a promise that no scams would occur and the company would help victims.  Woods also rejected a claim that Visa provided inadequate warnings on the cards' packaging about possible tampering, citing news coverage of \"card draining\" and comments in online forums about Visa Vanilla scams.",
