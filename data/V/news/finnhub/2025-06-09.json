The US economy is showing mixed trends at best as the Trump administration continues to overhaul the global trading system. First quarter GDP fell 0.3%, but is expected to bounce back slightly in the second quarter. Consumer confidence has been on a downtrend. And the world’s biggest consumer companies, including Walmart, Target, and Starbucks, have warned about sluggish spending trends by households.

So, where is the economy headed next, given the whirlwind of factors it’s facing? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast with Visa Chief Economist Wayne Best. Best is an economics veteran, armed with everything from insights on consumer spending from Visa (V) card swipes to the impact on the economy from the wealth effect of higher stock prices.
