    "summary": "U.S. bank PNC Financial said on Monday it would buy privately-held FirstBank Holding in a $4.1 billion cash-and-stock deal, adding momentum to a long-predicted wave of dealmaking among regional lenders.  The deal, which is expected to close in early 2026, will bring PNC closer to $600 billion in assets, and narrow its gap with rivals such as U.S. Bancorp.  It will also help PNC to expand in the fast-growing markets of Colorado and Arizona, bolstering its position in the western United States.",
