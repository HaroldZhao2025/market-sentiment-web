    "headline": "Palantir could be the next Salesforce or Oracle: Analyst",
    "summary": "Palantir (PLTR) shares are up more than 350% in 2024 and the stock's run may not be over yet, according to one analyst. Wedbush Securities global head of technology research Dan Ives says the company is \"transforming the AI revolution.\" \"What Palantir has, no one else could compete with. When you think about who could be the next Oracle (ORCL), the next Salesforce (CRM), I believe it's Palantir,\" Ives tells Yahoo Finance, advising investors to look at the stock's potential over the next 3-5 years. When asked what says Palantir apart, Ives points to their intellectual property, arguing that \"no one matches\" it. As far as valuation concerns go, Ives shrugs them off. \"If you just focus on valuation, you've missed all the transformational tech winners, from Apple (AAPL) to Meta (META) to Google (GOOGL, GOOG) to Tesla (TSLA) and others.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

    "summary": "In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff touted the company's AI agents. But investors may not want to get too excited about them just yet. D.A. Davidson senior software analyst Gil Luria thinks that these agents are not \"going to be enough of a success to drive revenue for a company that may approach $40 billion of revenue next year.\" Luria notes that the pricing models for AI agents are still a work in progress and that Salesforce (CRM) is trying a different method. \"What Salesforce is suggesting now is a per-transaction model. That actually scares customers because they don't want success to become a problem. If their users use this tool too much, then they're gonna have an unpredictable bill.\" Luria suggests that customers will need to adjust to being charged per transaction and, as a result, it will \"probably only drive very moderate revenue next year,\" he says.
