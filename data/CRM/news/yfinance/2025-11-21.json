    "summary": "Veeva Systems  raised its full-year outlook for the third quarter in a row but shares were sliding Friday as one detail from the earnings call overshadowed the software company’s quarterly results.  Shares declined 7.2% in the premarket session after Veeva said it expected to end up with just 14 of the largest 20 biopharmaceutical companies as Vault CRM customers, versus previous higher expectations, with rival  Salesforce  securing the other six.  Veeva broke off its partnership with  Salesforce  in 2022 and released Vault CRM, its customer relationship management platform, two years later to replace software it had built using Salesforce technology.",
