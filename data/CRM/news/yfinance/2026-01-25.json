    "summary": "Once a favorite of Wall Street, software stocks have been sliding lately, with investors increasingly concerned about how the sector could be upended by their newest crush: artificial-intelligence companies.  An S&P index of small and midsize software stocks is also down more than 20% over that period, with declines accelerating this month after the introduction of Anthropic’s Claude Code, an AI tool that industry insiders have said can dramatically shrink the time it takes to build even complex software.  At a time when many investors are wondering if the AI investment boom itself might be a bubble, software’s slump is a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change on Wall Street.",
