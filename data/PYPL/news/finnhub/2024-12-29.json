    "summary": "The financial technology, or fintech, industry was one of the hardest hit parts of the stock market in the post-pandemic bear market, but there are still some excellent opportunities.  PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is one great example with a stock price that is still about 70% below its 2021 peak and excellent turnaround progress in 2024, while SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) is an app-based bank with tremendous momentum.  After growth stagnated in the post-pandemic era and management didn't have a clear path to restoring the once-strong momentum, PayPal decided to make some big leadership changes.",
