    "summary": "Peter Thiel's hedge fund Thiel Macro sold around 76% of its stake in Tesla during the third quarter, according to the 13F filing, as the billionaire decided to reduce his holdings in fellow PayPal Mafia-member Elon Musk's EV giant amid possible AI bubble risks.  Thiel Macro sold 207,613 TSLA shares in Q3, cutting its Tesla position by about 76%.  After those sales, Thiel's fund holds 65,000 shares of Tesla, which remain its largest investment, valued at $28.91 million and representing 38.83% of the portfolio.",
