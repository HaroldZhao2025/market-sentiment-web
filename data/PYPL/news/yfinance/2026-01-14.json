Gavin Newsom maneuvers to defeat a levy that he fears will lead to an exodus of wealth.  A technology mecca, California has more billionaires than any other state — a few hundred, by some estimates.  Nearly half its personal income tax revenue, a financial backbone in the nearly $350 billion budget, comes from the top 1% of earners.",
