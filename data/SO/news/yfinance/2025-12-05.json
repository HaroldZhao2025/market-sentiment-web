    "summary": "With data centers flooding into Georgia, utility regulators face a big decision: Should they let Georgia Power Co. spend more than $15 billion to increase its electricity capacity by 50% over the next six years to serve computer complexes?  It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence.  The largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., Georgia Power said in testimony filed last month that the build-out will boost the state's economy and “allow Georgia to contribute to the nation’s focus on the global importance of artificial intelligence and the digital economy.”",
