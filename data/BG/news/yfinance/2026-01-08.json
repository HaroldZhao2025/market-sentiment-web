Treasury yields have also come down from their mid-2025 peaks as traders bet the Federal Reserve will keep cutting rates while the economy cools.  If the nation’s top court says Trump exceeded his power with the blanket tariffs on countries around the globe, there will still be significant longer-term uncertainty, given that the White House could seek to re-impose similar levies by invoking different legal authority.",
