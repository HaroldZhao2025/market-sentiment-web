Glencore became the owner of the 16.4% stake after Bunge closed a long-delayed deal to merge with Glencore-backed grain handler Viterra in July, two years after announcing the $34 billion mega-deal.  \"The agriculture business is not necessarily consistent with our business model,\" Glencore CEO Gary Nagle told a media call on Wednesday after the company released its first-half financial results.",
