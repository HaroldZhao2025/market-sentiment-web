    "summary": "No AI magic trick is quite as impressive as the one it’s doing in financial markets—giving some utilities an upper hand with tech giants that are 100 times their size.  A handful of utilities are poised to profit from the rush of spending by big tech firms, locking in a decade or more of cash flows to provide power to data centers.  Tech companies are desperate to plug in their AI data centers, each of which can use 50 to 100 times as much power as the Empire State Building to run and cool their servers.",
