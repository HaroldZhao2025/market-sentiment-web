In a Wednesday court filing, Uber urged U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco to order 21 plaintiffs with suspect receipts to justify why their claims should not be dismissed, and 90 plaintiffs with no receipts to either provide them or \"non-boilerplate\" reasons for their absence.  At least 11 law firms represent the various plaintiffs, court papers show.",
