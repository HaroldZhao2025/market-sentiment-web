    "summary": "General Motors  has scrapped its Cruise robotaxi program after nearly a decade and $10 billion in development, citing the time and costs needed to scale the business and rising competition.  GM on Tuesday said it plans to realign its autonomous driving strategy and give priority to development of advanced driver assistance systems, which take over steering and other functions in certain situations and are common on new vehicles today.  The automaker said it would continue to develop fully autonomous technology for personal vehicles, and build on the progress of its Super Cruise system, a hands-off, eyes-on driving feature that the company introduced several years ago.",
