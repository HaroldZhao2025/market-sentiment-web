Goldman Sachs analysts has tapped Uber (UBER) as its top stock pick for 2025, with analyst Eric Sheridan highlighting the company's compelling risk-reward profile. Sheridan believes Uber has significant upside potential, driven by its advertising business. Similarly, Morgan Stanley's team has named Apple (AAPL) as a top pick for the coming year, citing artificial intelligence as a key catalyst for an iPhone upgrade cycle. The firm anticipates AI will fuel growth in both sales and gross margins for the tech giant. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has initiated a broad downgrade of homebuilder stocks, including DR Horton (DHI), Toll Brothers (TOL), and Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH). The firm cited a less favorable demand and supply landscape heading into 2025. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.
