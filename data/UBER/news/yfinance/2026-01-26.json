    "summary": "Opening Bid Unfiltered is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. One of the most prolific venture capitalists of the past 20 years is looking to share some wisdom to the next generation of investors and job seekers. Benchmark general partner Bill Gurley is seen as a heavyweight in Silicon Valley. His claim to fame is an $11 million bet on Uber (UBER) in 2011. But other key investments have included Twitter and Nextdoor (NXDR). Indeed, Gurley has seen it all over the course of his career, everything from the dot.com bubble burst to the current emergence of the AI revolution. He even worked on the Amazon (AMZN) IPO! In his new book dubbed Runnin' Down a Dream: How to Thrive in a Career You Actually Love, Gurley shares several principles to finding success in one’s career. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Gurley to discuss observations he makes in his book and the outlook for tech in a new defining era.
