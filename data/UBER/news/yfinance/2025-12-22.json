        "summary": "Uber and Lyft said on Monday they were teaming up with Chinese tech giant Baidu to launch driverless taxi ​trials in the UK next year, reinforcing the country's role as ‌Europe's leading testbed for commercializing robotaxis.  As part of the partnerships, Baidu's Apollo Go RT6 vehicles will ‌join the London networks of the ride-hailing platforms in 2026, marking the first direct competition between U.S. and Chinese autonomous giants in a European capital, following Alphabet-owned Waymo's recent start of supervised tests in the city.  The UK's emergence as a global ⁠sandbox is fueled by ‌the Automated Vehicles Act 2024, which provides a legal framework for liability that currently eludes the more fragmented European Union.",
