    "summary": "(Reuters) -SoFi Technologies jumped back into the exchange-traded fund business on Wednesday with its first launch in nearly two years, betting on artificial intelligence, the hottest theme in retail investing.  The new fund, SoFi Agentic AI ETF, will target what SoFi calls “next-generation AI” companies, such as those developing self-driving vehicles, autonomous technology and cybersecurity networks, as well as AI stalwarts such as semiconductor and cloud computing firms.  The debut comes as enthusiasm for all things AI faces a test, with investors asking tougher questions about sky-high valuations of AI leaders like Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, as well as AI's ability to generate outsize productivity and profitability gains.",
