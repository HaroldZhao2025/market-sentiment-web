The new fund, SoFi Agentic AI ETF, will target what SoFi calls “next-generation AI” companies, such as those developing self-driving vehicles, autonomous technology and cybersecurity networks, as well as AI stalwarts such as semiconductor and cloud computing firms.  The debut comes as enthusiasm for all things AI faces a test, with investors asking tougher questions about sky-high valuations of AI leaders like Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, as well as AI's ability to generate outsize productivity and profitability gains.",
