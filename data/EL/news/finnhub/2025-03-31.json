U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said shareholders identified \"several misleading omissions\" and \"half-truths\" in Estee disclosures, related to the negative sales impact from a January 2022 government crackdown on the \"daigou\" gray market.  Shareholders in the proposed class action said Estee became dependent in China on \"daigou,\" or duty-free purchases by resellers, after the COVID-19 pandemic began, especially in the Hainan province.",
