    "headline": "Tariffs are the last thing apparel industry needs: Rebecca Minkoff",
    "summary": "Retailers are getting swept into the black vortex that are tariff headlines from the Trump administration. Big names such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Gap (GAP), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) have warned about the impact of tariffs this year on profits. In the meantime, shoppers are growing concerned about what they will be paying for spring and summer apparel once tariffs kick in. The reality is that consumers may resist the higher prices, sending retailers off to offer profit-busting discounts and earnings warnings. Luxury goods companies are by no means immune to the challenges as their results have been powered by international shoppers and a wealthy class feasting on strong stock market gains (until now). Is there any reason to be optimistic about the sector? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with noted fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff for her perspective on the state of retail. Minkoff created her company from the ground floor in the mid-2000s and has seen some of the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows in retail. Minkoff is also the author of the new book Fearless: The New Rules for Unlocking Creativity, Courage, and Success, where she aims to impart leadership wisdom to the next generation of female entrepreneurs. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid is produced by Langston Sessoms",
