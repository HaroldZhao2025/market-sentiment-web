As the country's and the world's biggest retailer, Walmart has arguably more exposure to consumer spending than any other company, though its reputation for low prices may make it better positioned than some other retailers to weather a recession.  As of 2:07 p.m. ET, Walmart stock was down 2.9% on the news.",
