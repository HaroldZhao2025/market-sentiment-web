    "summary": "Walmart's (WMT) recent decision to eliminate its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies has sparked a broader conversation about corporate social responsibility. Mills Sadat Dowlat (MSD) LLP Partner Camron Dowlatshahi joins Market Domination Overtime to share his outlook on this evolving landscape. Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took \"a strong stance supporting under-represented communities.\" However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with \"the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations,\" pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that \"discrimination is still discrimination.\" The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance \"I have seen an increase in fear, frankly.\" \"The hope is that we can stand on state and federal law that has been in place for decades and decades,\" the MSD partner concludes.

    "summary": "Walmart has been named Yahoo Finance's 2024 Company of the Year. Its stock is up nearly 80% year to date, and sales are booming. Why? In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explains how pre-pandemic investments are starting to pay off. \"We invested in wages for our associates. We invested in our people, things like education. We invested in lower prices, we invested in e-commerce, we invested in technology, all within a pretty tight period of time,\" he said. One thing that's helping to boost the bottom line is the type of customer Walmart (WMT) is drawing in. The company says it is increasingly attracting more higher-income consumers. McMillon thinks that convenience has been drawing a different customer base. He also discusses inflation, noting that the prices for general merchandise are falling faster than food items. A top-of-mind topic for many CEOs right now is the threat of a trade war, with President-elect Trump threatening to enact more tariffs. McMillon thinks Walmart is \"positioned to manage\" tariffs but worries that customers may see higher prices, even though the retail giant plans to \"do everything we can to try and keep them low.\" There's one technology McMillon is excited about — generative AI. \"It's going to help us be more anticipatory for customers and members ... The world will look more like personal shopping assistance than it will an old-fashioned search bar with a laundry list of results that you and I then have to work through as a customer. Just saving us time, making it more convenient, helping us solve problems,\" McMillon said of the tech. Watch the video above to hear what McMillon expects for Walmart over the next 10 years.
