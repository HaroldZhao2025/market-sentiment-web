Despite looming uncertainties, she explains that \"retailers are very agile, they know how to move.\" \"I think 2025 is the year of the letter 'S,'\" Telsey states. She explains this framework encompasses social media's role in brand building and mission, supply-chain challenges amid tariff concerns, enhanced customer service, and the element of \"surprise.\" \"Social, service, supply chain, and surprise are what I think the year will be made up of, and I think you could have some winners there,\" Telsey adds, identifying potential leaders including Warby Parker (WRBY), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Walmart (WMT), and Burlington (BURL). Regarding Walmart specifically, Telsey highlights the retailer's diversification beyond traditional stores, noting these initiatives are \"becoming more additive with their other revenue streams to their total business,\" helping the company expand its market share.
