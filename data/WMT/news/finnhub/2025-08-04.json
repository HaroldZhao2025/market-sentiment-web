Lesotho's tariff rate was slashed to 15% in last week's executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump, down from the level of 50% tariff threatened in April - which was the highest of any U.S. trading partner.  Textile industry players in the country - which produces jeans and other garments for popular U.S. brands such as Levi's and Walmart - said the uncertainty around tariffs over the past few months had already devastated the sector, with orders cancelled and jobs cut.",
