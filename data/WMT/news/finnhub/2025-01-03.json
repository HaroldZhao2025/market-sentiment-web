The agency alleged last week that for approximately two years starting in 2021, Walmart and Branch violated federal law by forcing 1 million drivers on its so-called Spark program to use Branch to get paid and that they would terminate workers who didn't want to use these accounts.  Walmart's Spark program uses gig workers who make deliveries from Walmart stores nationwide on so-called “last mile” deliveries.",
