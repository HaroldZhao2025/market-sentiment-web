    "summary": "The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) is seeing steady gains this year, rising more than 10%. Market Domination Overtime host Akiko Fujita names some of the top performers including Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Philip Morris (PM), and Colgate-Palmolive (CL).

Another consumer doing well is Philip Morris — with the tobacco consumer gaining 30% in its smoke-free products.
