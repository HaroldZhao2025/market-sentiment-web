Walmart (WMT) was named Yahoo Finance's 2024 Comeback of the Year on the strength of its stock and earnings performance. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi spoke with CEO Doug McMillon about how the retailer's big investments have been paying off, while CFO John David Rainey explained that the company's recent success didn't happen by accident. Yahoo Finance's Surprise of the Year was General Motors (GM). CEO Mary Barra credits the automaker's diverse portfolio for its big success. Bank of America auto analyst John Murphy also weighed in to give his take on what could be next for the stock. Nvidia's (NVDA) AI-focused Blackwell platform was named Product of the Year. Comeback of the Year went to Robinhood (HOOD). Its stock has surged and it made big headway in diversifying its product offerings. CEO Vlad Tenev discusses what's next for the company while Mizuho senior analyst Dan Dolev argues Robinhood is a stock to own under the incoming Trump administration.
