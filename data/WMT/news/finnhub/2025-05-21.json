      "summary": "(Reuters) -Target slashed its annual sales forecast on Wednesday, after a surprisingly sharp fall in quarterly same-store sales, as customers pulled back on discretionary purchases due to ongoing worries about inflation and the economy due to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war.  Target also said its first-quarter performance was affected by negative reactions to its pullback on diversity, equity and inclusion policies (DEI) in January, which angered some loyal customers who have long praised the company's commitment to inclusiveness.  In the last 12 months, the stock has lost 40% of its value, while Costco shares have gained 30% and Walmart shares have doubled.",
