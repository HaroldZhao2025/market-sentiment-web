    "summary": "(Reuters) -Amazon will seek to reassure investors on Thursday that its cloud business, a critical driver of profits, is growing at a fast enough clip to offset any pullback in consumer spending that could throttle its retail operations.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud unit that accounts for less than a fifth of the company's sales but typically about 60% of its profit, likely grew 17% in the April-June period.  Amazon, like its rivals Alphabet and Microsoft, has invested heavily to increase capacity at its data centers to meet demand for its traditional cloud services as well as the surge in generative AI services.",
