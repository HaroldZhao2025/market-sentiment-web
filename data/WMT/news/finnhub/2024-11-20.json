The results \"weren't great,\" Bakers says, explaining there was \"weakness in the third quarter, particularly in discretionary categories. Inventory was a little bit high and continued weakness. [And] it sounds like into the fourth quarter with some potential markdown risks.\" \"Really, the trifecta, I suppose, of bad news, and it is worrisome. I think it's more worrisome for Target specifically than for the overall consumer economy. There are other retailers that are actually doing a little bit better than expected in this environment.
