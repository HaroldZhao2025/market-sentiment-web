    "summary": "Separating its crop-seed unit from its pesticide business could help shield its seeds from any potential future liabilities associated with its pest and weed-killing chemicals, the report said, adding that the company is expected to reveal plans soon, barring any last-minute snags.  Corteva, spun off from chemical conglomerate DowDuPont in 2019, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  \"If Corteva decides to separate... it would give investors better choices as there would be a pure-play leading seeds company and pure-play leading crop protection firm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.",
