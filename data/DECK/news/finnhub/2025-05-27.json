    "summary": "On Holding is Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day, as the Swiss shoemaker continues to hold up.  ONON stock traded just above a buy point despite rival Deckers triggering a sector sell-off late last week.  This includes nearly a 7% collective decline on Friday after Deckers beat views, but guided lower amid fears that product price hikes will spur \"demand erosion\" due to President Donald Trump's tariff policies.",
