    "summary": "Having nearly quadrupled this year while also joining the S&P 500 index, Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) has no doubt gained a lot of investor attention.  The biggest knock on Palantir is not its business, which has been seeing accelerating growth as commercial and government customers begin adopting its AI platform, but a valuation that has ballooned to a forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 45.7 times analyst estimates for 2025 revenue, and a staggering 147 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, as of this writing.  Against that backdrop, let's look at two cheaper AI stocks growing revenue at a similar rate as Palantir that investors could consider as alternatives.",
