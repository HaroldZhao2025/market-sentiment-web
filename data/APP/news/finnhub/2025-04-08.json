    "summary": "Shares of AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) were surging today after the adtech stock caught a tailwind from the broader market recovery on hopes for a détente in the trade war, and as one Wall Street analyst weighed in on the stock with a positive note.  After a two-day swoon last week on President Trump's global tariffs that sent the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) into a bear market, the market seemed to be finding its footing as reports of negotiations with countries like Japan and Vietnam led investors to believe that the trade war could soon be resolved, or ended.  AppLovin, which is a high-priced, fast-growing adtech company, has been hit hard by the sell-off due to its valuation and the sensitivity of the advertising industry to a recession.",
