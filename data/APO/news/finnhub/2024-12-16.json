When Rowan, 62 years old, came back from a “semi-sabbatical” in 2021 to take the helm from fellow co-founder and longtime CEO  Leon Black,  he told people he expected to do the job for five years or less, according to people familiar with the matter.  Trump ultimately tapped investor Scott Bessent for the role, but the situation brought attention to the fact that Rowan has yet to spell out a clear succession plan.",
