    "summary": "As investors assess the impacts of President-elect Donald Trump's second term in the White House, Thomas H Lee Partners Co-CEO Scott Sperling joins Catalysts Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to outline his outlook for private equity. Mark Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management (APO), Yahoo's parent company, and a contender for Trump's Treasury secretary pick, told Yahoo Finance that he expects \"you will see for us small additions to our capability through acquisitions.\" The private equity company CEO added, \"We have so much to do in just our base business that it's some new toys.\" \"One of the things that that we're expecting with the new administration is a significant bump in the potential for growth in the overall economy and a reduction in the cost of doing business through a number of the things that you just mentioned,\" Sperling says, adding, \"I think probably most powerfully, it has been a very onerous regulatory regime over the last four years.\" He says that regulatory hurdles under the Biden administration raise \"the bar significantly in terms of the cost of [mergers and acquisitions] M&A. But there are many, many areas where just the overall cost of doing business in the country has risen significantly because of the regulatory environment.\" Sperling adds, \"All of this has been exacerbated by recent moves to try to take some of our leading technology champions and put them under significant pressure, again from an antitrust perspective, but also in other regulatory areas. All putting a little bit of a pall over the area that the markets find to be most interesting from a growth perspective.\" Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.
