    "summary": "The Interior Department plans to move to remand and vacate a permit granted to the $6 billion Maryland Offshore Wind Project, according to a court filing dated Friday.  The project, which will consist of as many as 114 wind turbines about 10 nautical miles off the coast of Ocean City, Maryland, was approved by the Biden administration in 2024 and was set to begin construction next year.  The Interior Department on Friday also halted work on an 80% complete offshore wind farm being constructed off the coast of Rhode Island by Denmark’s Orsted A/S. The moves underscore the risks facing the nascent offshore wind industry under President Donald Trump, who has fought against a wind project within view of his golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland.",
