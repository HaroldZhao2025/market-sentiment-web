    "summary": "President Trump is expected to sign an executive order in the coming days designed to help make private-market investments more available to U.S. retirement plans, according to people familiar with the matter.  The order would instruct the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide guidance to employers and plan administrators on including investments like private assets in 401(k) plans, the people said.  An order could help pave the way for big managers of private assets such as  Apollo Global Management  and Blackstone to access the vast sums of retirement savings held by workers who don’t have a traditional pension.",
