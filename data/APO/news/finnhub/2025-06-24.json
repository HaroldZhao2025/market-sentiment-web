    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Brighthouse Financial has narrowed down a field of suitors to money manager TPG and Abu Dhabi-backed financial investor Aquarian Holdings, as the U.S. life insurance and annuity provider continues to explore a potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.  While there was interest from other parties, including a bid from the insurance arm of investment firm Sixth Street, as well as an offer from fellow insurer Jackson Financial to buy part of Brighthouse's operations, the two remaining parties are best positioned to buy the entire company in one piece, they said.  Apollo Global Management, which has a substantial insurance business, was expected to be a strong contender in the Brighthouse process but ultimately did not submit a bid by the mid-June deadline for offers, according to two other sources.",
