    "headline": "AI Fears Sink Shares of Private-Credit Fund Managers",
    "summary": "Shares of private-fund managers fell sharply Tuesday on concerns that the advent of artificial intelligence will tank their investments in software companies.  Ares Management and Blue Owl Capital shares dropped more than 9%, while Apollo Global Management and KKR fell more than 7% and Blackstone lost over 5%.  The moves follow a steep selloff in public stocks and debt of software companies that some analysts fear will become obsolete as more companies turn to AI for their technology needs.",
