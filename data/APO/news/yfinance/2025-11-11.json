    "summary": "Papa John’s International  stock jumped as much as 15% and was halted on Monday after a report appeared online of a potential takeover by TriArtisan Capital Advisors.  It appeared on ABC Money, a U.K.-based website that isn’t associated with ABC News, the news division of American Broadcasting Company owned by  The Walt Disney  Company, but is designed to look like it is.  Barron’s reached out to Papa John’s and TriArtisan Capital Advisors on Monday to comment on the acquisition rumor, and didn’t get a response before publication.",
