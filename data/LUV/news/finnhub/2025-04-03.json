Not only will the tariffs affect over 180 countries around the world, but for the most part, they were also far worse than experts had anticipated.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 5.5%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 index fell by 6% and is now in bear market territory because it is over 20% below its previous high.",
