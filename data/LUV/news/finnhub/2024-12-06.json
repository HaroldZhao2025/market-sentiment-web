    "summary": "A U.S. judge on Friday said Southwest Airlines must face a lawsuit by a prominent affirmative action opponent claiming a now-defunct program that awarded free flights to Hispanic college students was racially discriminatory.  U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater in Dallas said Southwest's elimination of the 20-year-old program and offer to pay Edward Blum's American Alliance for Equal Rights one cent - the amount of damages sought in the lawsuit - did not make moot  claims that the airline discriminated against two students, one white and the other Asian.  Since 2004, Southwest's \"¡Lánzate!\" program helped 1,500 Hispanic undergraduate and graduate students who lived at least 200 miles (322 km) from their school.",
