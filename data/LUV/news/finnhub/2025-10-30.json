Ralenkotter started at the LVCVA as a newly minted M.B.A. in 1973 and ascended to serve as its president and CEO for 14 years, becoming one of the U.S. travel industry’s most distinguished leaders.  When Ralenkotter died Oct. 10 at 78 from cancer, which he had for 16 years, former Las Vegas mayors Oscar Goodman and Carolyn Goodman said in a joint statement, “No one worked harder than Rossi Ralenkotter to make us what we’ve become,” and U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D., Nev.) called him “a true Nevadan whose love of Las Vegas helped propel the city to the travel and tourism capital it is today.”",
