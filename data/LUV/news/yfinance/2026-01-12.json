        "summary": "Delta  Air Lines reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, which could set the flight path for the sector’s stocks for the remainder of 2026.  The industry had a turbulent year in 2025 but ultimately proved resilient, bouncing back from a number of headwinds, including hits to demand and sentiment from President Donald Trump’s trade policy and the 43-day government shutdown.  Delta, the first carrier to report this earnings season, will set the tone for the industry this year—and things may be looking up.",
