    "summary": "Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan said on Thursday the company is looking at long-haul international flights and premium airport lounges as part of its turnaround strategy.  Jordan said while the company will have to look at a wide-body aircraft for long-haul international service, it could use  a \"more risk-tolerant\" approach at first and choose a narrow body to serve those routes.  The Dallas-based carrier, which operates mostly domestic flights with a fleet of Boeing 737 jets, has been struggling to find its footing after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
