    "summary": "The company also said the appointment follows Rakesh Gangwal's decision to step down from his role as chair, due to additional time commitments unrelated to Southwest, but would still remain on board.  Southwest also announced formation of a new \"Fleet Oversight Committee\" to assist the board in its oversight of the carrier's aircraft fleet acquisition strategy, of which Gangwal would serve as chair.  Among some of the changes, Southwest has ended its open seating policy, which had been central to its brand image for more than 50 years; it also rolled out a new basic economy fare and, in the last quarter, it began charging customers for checked bags, ending a unique free policy.",
