      "summary": "DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor said on Wednesday that U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles, as well as on steel and aluminum, will likely cost more than expected for the year, and the automaker's shares slid about 3% in after-market trading.  Ford reported that second-quarter results took an $800-million hit from tariffs, a less pronounced impact than some of its U.S. rivals thanks to Ford's strong domestic manufacturing base.  For the full year, the automaker lifted the higher range of its projected hit to gross revenues from tariffs by $500 million, to $3 billion.",
