    "summary": "Ford (F) shares drop following a downgrade, with Bernstein senior analyst Daniel Roeska explaining the decision behind the call on Yahoo Finance live. Roeska discusses why he downgraded the stock from outperform to market perform after the company reported mixed results for its third-quarter earnings. The main concern, Roeska tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton, is large discounting from Stellantis (STLA) which will create pricing pressures across the industry in the first half of 2025. While confident in Ford’s truck business, including the F-150, Roeska explains that with significant discounts from competitor Ram, Ford “will not have the opportunity to react and cut costs.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.This post was written by Cindy Mizaku.",
