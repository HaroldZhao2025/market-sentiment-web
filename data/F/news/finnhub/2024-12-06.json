    "summary": "With President-elect Donald Trump considering eliminating the EV tax credit for individuals, InCharge Energy COO and co-founder Terry O'Day joins Catalysts Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss the impact on commercial fleet electrification efforts. \"For a lot of these companies, particularly the manufacturers, this is a story about global competitiveness for them. The Asian market [and] the European market [are] both well ahead of [the US] in electrifying, and they have products and investments that are still coming to fruition,\" O'Day says. InCharge Energy, which partners with BYD (BYDDY), Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Honda (HMC), and FedEx (FDX), is seeing companies' efforts to electrify their fleets persist despite the incoming Trump administration. The COO notes, \"We need to keep our automakers competitive. We need to continue to focus on the investments that are going to put them into technologies that allow them to compete globally. So they're telling us, yes, they intend to continue most of those investments.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
