    "summary": "Ford Motor Co's UK chair has called on the British government to provide consumer incentives of up to £5,000 per electric vehicle, Sky News reported on Tuesday. Global automakers face new challenges as they struggle to profit from their electrified ventures, with stiff competition from affordable Chinese vehicles and uneven EV demand. Lisa Brankin, Ford's UK and Ireland chair, said direct support for consumers to purchase zero-emission vehicles was crucial for industry viability, according to the report.",

    "summary": "Stellantis (STLA) CEO Carlos Tavares resigned from his leadership role at the automaker over reported disagreements with the board of directors. As the company searches for a new CEO, what are some problem areas the next chief executive should prioritize? \"To stabilize things... first you have to tell investors, 'Look, double-digit profit margins are not going to happen right now.' Especially in this era of electrification, that was a pandemic-era phenomenon,\" Autolist Editor-in-Chief David Undercoffler tells Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts. \"Now the inventory levels have stabilized and you're seeing dealers are really clamoring for more incentives... There's a huge stockpile of Stellantis vehicles sitting on dealer lots. You've got to sit down with dealers and work out how are you going to get those sold.\" Undercoffler goes on to comment about Ford (F) and General Motors' (GM) EV competition with Tesla (TSLA), especially as new tariff policies proposed by President-elect Donald Trump could hang on Mexico vehicle production for the two US automakers.
