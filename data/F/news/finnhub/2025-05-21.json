    "summary": "Ford sued several California lawyers and law firms on Wednesday, accusing them of fraudulently inflating their legal fees under that state's Lemon Law, including one instance where a lawyer allegedly billed 57-1/2 hours in one day. In a complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court against nine defendants, Ford called the alleged improper billings a \"magical mystery tour\" of bogus work and time entries, spread across thousands of cases against several automakers so they would go undetected. Ford said the law firm Knight Law Group anchored the scheme, regularly bringing in other law firms to overstaff cases, sometimes with 10 to 15 lawyers.",
