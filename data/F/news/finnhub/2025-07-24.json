    "summary": "Trade partners with the U.S. could lower tariff rates set to kick in next week by striking deals similar to the one made with Japan, President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday.  Speaking at the construction site for the Federal Reserve headquarters currently under renovation, he said that Japan effectively bought down its tariff rate by committing to invest $550 billion in U.S. industries, such as energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, and pharmaceutical production.  Asked if other countries could buy down their rates as well, Trump responded, “Ya, I would let them buy it down.”",
