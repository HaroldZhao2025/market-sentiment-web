Ford Motor’s  announcement this past week that it was ending this generation of the money-losing F-150 Lightning (along with refocusing its EV strategy) and taking a $19.5 billion hit wasn’t just a huge blow to Chief Executive  Jim Farley.  Ford’s move was cheered on by those seeing it as proof that when the government cuts incentives and rules aimed at helping EVs, as the Trump administration has done, customers will vote with their wallets against green technology.",
