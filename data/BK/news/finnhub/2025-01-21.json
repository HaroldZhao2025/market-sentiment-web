    "headline": "Deregulation to boost banks, a 'force for strength in the economy'",
    "summary": "Bank of New York Mellon (BK) CEO Robin Vince joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to discuss US President Donald Trump's return to the White House and his expectations for the president's second term and the impact on the financial sector. \"To see a government that's really focused on growth and being able to make the economy everything that it can be, because ultimately, as one of America's leading banks, we are focused on helping our customers to be able to grow and thrive. You know, that's what our platforms are all about,\" Vince says. As deregulation under Trump is expected to benefit the financial sector, Vince says he's \"not that concerned\" about the risks associated with loose regulation. \"We have to be vigilant that that doesn't happen. We need a strong, healthy financial system,\" he says, explaining, \" We've seen how the strong banks have been able to actually help the system over the course of the events ... We've been a force for strength in the economy, and that's actually the role that we should be playing.\" The CEO underlines, \"I'm looking forward. I'm thinking about the innovation. I'm thinking about the investment. I'm thinking about helping to make economies grow and our clients be successful.\" Watch the video above to hear more from the BNY CEO on tariff expectations, a potential uptick in merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, and his crypto outlook.

    "headline": "Could the Fed hike rates? Don't 'rule out anything,' BNY CEO says.",
    "summary": "Bank of New York (BK) CEO Robin Vince and Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sit down at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to talk about US President Donald Trump's second term with a focus on the impact of tariffs, inflation, and the Federal Reserve's next move. Trump has indicated he plans a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the United States, with more significant targeted tariffs for some, like China. There has been debate about whether Trump will actually instate the significant tariffs or if the rhetoric is a negotiation tactic. \"Tariffs are and always have been a tool of trade policy, and the president's made it very clear that he wants them to be used as part of trade policy,\" Vince says. The CEO notes, \"I think if you put tariffs on top of everyday items that Americans are consuming, that they go to their local store, grocery store, or home goods store and buy, they can be inflationary. But at the same time, tariffs well applied can also make US businesses more competitive.\" Discussing what to expect from the Fed, Vince says, \"I don't think anybody should rule out anything,\" including a rate hike from the Fed. We're risk managers. It's our job to be prepared. It's our job to be agile,\" he says, adding, \"You've got to be able to work with Congress, with the incoming administration, with regulators, and you've got to be able to adjust.\" The bank CEO says he expects the Fed to pause while the US economy sees how inflation plays out.
