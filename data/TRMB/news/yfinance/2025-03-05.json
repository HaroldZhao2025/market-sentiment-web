    "summary": "Both companies have excellent underlying growth rates in their recurring revenue, resulting in excellent cash flow generation in the coming years.  In both cases, the growth is demonstrated in their recurring contract and subscription revenue, which ultimately guides their free cash flow (FCF) rather than in their revenue lines.  The reasoning is that both companies offer solutions that are integral parts of their customers' long-term operations, rather than being a one-off sale of hardware or on-premises software.",
