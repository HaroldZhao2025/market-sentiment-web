    "summary": "A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after the major indices pulled back (Nasdaq -1.3%, S&P 500 - 1.4%) as Treasury yields rose, reflecting market anxiety over a draft federal budget that could worsen the already wide US fiscal deficit. A poor auction for 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds further raised concerns, as weak demand implies investors are becoming more cautious about holding long-dated U.S. debt.",
