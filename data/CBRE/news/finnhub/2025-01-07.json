    "summary": "CBRE Group (CBRE) reported the first increase in real estate transaction volume in over two years during the third quarter of 2024. Janus Henderson Investors portfolio manager of global real estate Gregory Kuhl joins Catalysts to analyze the implications of this transaction data for the broader commercial real estate sector. According to Kuhl, transaction data reveals a sharp decline throughout 2022 and 2023, followed by a recovery in 2024. He explains that higher interest rates necessitated a commercial real estate market revaluation, stating, \"That basically has taken place over the last 2 years.\" With buyers and sellers now reaching consensus on price levels conducive to transactions, Kuhl anticipates further improvement in the first quarter of 2025. For a full analysis of how Kuhl believes interest rates will influence commercial real estate sector performance in 2025, viewers can watch the full video above.
