President-elect Donald Trump's new administration appears \"very focused on trying to make sure that the economy performs well,\" Stankey says. \"If I go back to the last Trump administration, certainly from a tax policy perspective, it was pro-growth and pro-investment.

As a result of that, tax policy influences us significantly.\" He remains optimistic about Trump's use of \"pragmatic\" tariffs before the president-elect actually deploys any taxes. Stankey foresees another \"pro-investment\" Trump administration could catapult AT&T's installation of fiber optic cables across the US. Stankey also gives his opinion on Trump's Federal Communications Commission nominee Brendan Carr, calling him a \"very reasoned policymaker\" who also understands the wireless industry.
