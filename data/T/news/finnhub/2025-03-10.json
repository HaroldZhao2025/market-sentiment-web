    "summary": "The U.S. telecom giant has been investing in its high-speed fiber internet offerings to help drive faster subscriber and revenue growth, at a time when the pool of potential new wireless customers shrinks in the United States.  On an adjusted basis, the company expects per-share earnings of 48 cents or higher excluding DIRECTV, compared with estimates of 49 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.  AT&T, which acquired DirecTV in 2015, said last year in September that it would sell its entire 70% stake in satellite TV provider DirecTV to private equity firm TPG, exiting a business marked by declining distributions for the telecom operator.",
