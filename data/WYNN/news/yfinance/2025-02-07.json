    "summary": "Casino mogul Steve Wynn has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal that, if granted, could give the justices a chance to revisit libel protections for journalists enshrined in a landmark 1964 ruling that has been questioned by two conservative justices and President Donald Trump.  The court established a stringent limit on defamation claims by public figures more than 60 years ago in its New York Times v. Sullivan decision involving the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections for freedom of speech and the press.  Wynn, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts and former finance chair of the Republican National Committee, is appealing a decision by Nevada's top court to dismiss his defamation suit against the Associated Press and one of its journalists.",
