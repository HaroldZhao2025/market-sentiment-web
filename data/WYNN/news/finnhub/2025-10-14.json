The S&P 500, a market-cap weighted index, was down about 0.5%, dragged lower by losses in megacap techs (and artificial intelligence darlings) such as Nvidia, Oracle, Broadcom and Arista Networks.  Wells Fargo was a top gainer in the index following solid earnings. Ditto for Domino’s Pizza, a recent Barron’s stock pick. Casino stocks MGM Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts were rallying too, as were Airbnb and retailers Walmart and Dollar Tree.",
