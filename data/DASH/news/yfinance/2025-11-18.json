        "summary": "An outage that knocked swaths of the internet offline was resolved Tuesday, after downing social-media sites, disrupting retail sales and stalling transportation networks.  Users visiting sites including X, ChatGPT,  DoorDash  IKEA and New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority were met with error messages relating to  Cloudflare  a cloud provider used by major companies for security tools that protect from cyberattacks and traffic surges.  A spokeswoman for Cloudflare said an unusual rise in traffic to one of its services at around 6:20 a.m. ET caused traffic passing through the company’s network to experience errors.",
