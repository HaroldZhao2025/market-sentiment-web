    "summary": "Shares of the bank stocks JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) fell 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, for no obvious reason but likely due to new economic data and ongoing tariff news that seems to change daily.  New jobs data from February once again missed economist estimates and pointed to further weakness in the economy.  The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1% when economists had expected 4%, and average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from the prior month, in line with expectations.",
