Instead, the move is being fueled by the announcement that the Federal Reserve's top banking regulator, Michael Barr, whose official title is vice chair for supervision, is stepping down from his role effective Feb. 28.  There was widespread speculation that President-elect Donald Trump would try to remove Barr after taking office, but now any potential dispute is off the table.",
