Wells Fargo has chosen to reward Scharf handsomely for that—with a big incentive to stay in his seat for six more years.  Wells Fargo said Thursday that it would name Scharf chairman of the board—giving him the dual role of chairman and CEO, common at big U.S. banks—and add a lead independent director to the board.",
