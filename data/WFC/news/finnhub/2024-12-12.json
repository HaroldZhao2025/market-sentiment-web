Goldman Sachs (GS) global investment research managing director & senior analyst Alex Blostein joined Catalysts to share insights from top banking executives. Blostein highlighted an overall sense of optimism about the economy. He noted that pent-up capital market activity is \"translating to some of the more actionable steps,\" with substantial capital on the sidelines. Additionally, he emphasized that everything related to private markets \"continues to feel really healthy.\" Looking ahead to 2025, Blostein identified two primary trends: a focus on equity capital markets and increased mergers and acquisitions activity under the anticipated Trump administration. \"The availability of financing across the banking industry... is probably as good as it's been in a long time,\" he explained. This favorable financing environment \"should give people an opportunity to actually deliver on some of those exits.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
