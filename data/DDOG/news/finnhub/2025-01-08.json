    "summary": "Today, I'm looking at a bear call spread that assumes Datadog will struggle to get above the 150 level between now and the end of January.  A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.  A Jan. 31 expiry bear call spread on Datadog using the 150-155 strike prices can be sold for around $1.25, based on late-Tuesday quotes.",
