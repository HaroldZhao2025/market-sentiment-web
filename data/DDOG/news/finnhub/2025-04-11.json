    "summary": "The benchmark index rebounded more than 9% on April 9 when President Donald Trump announced a 90-day delay on the reciprocal tariffs he unveiled a week earlier, but it dropped sharply again on April 10 and remains firmly in correction territory at 15% below its record high.  Of course, the stock market may fall even further if the Trump administration proceeds with the tariffs after the postponement expires, but Wall Street still thinks AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) and Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) are oversold, as detailed below.  AppLovin stock is 48% below its record high.",
