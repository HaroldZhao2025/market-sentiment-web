    "summary": "Snowflake  and  CrowdStrike  stocks will try to buck a software slump when they report earnings later this week.  Bulls might argue the fund is retesting a prior double bottom breakout, but in a worst-case scenario, the ETF could slide through $100 toward the round-number level near $90, which was the site of a former cup-with-handle breakout from a year ago.  CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity stock, is up 22% this year but has faced headwinds since mid-July, dropping on 21 of the last 33 trading sessions.",
