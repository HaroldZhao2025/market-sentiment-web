Catalysts Funds co-founder and chief investment officer David Miller sits down with Market Domination Overtime Co-Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss what Trump's DOJ antitrust pick and comments about Big Tech signal ahead of his second term in the White House. \"I think it is a signal as to what an amazing position these companies are in,\" Miller says, adding, \"There's never been a time in history where companies had such incredible global market share, such high margins, such significant tailwinds to their growth, that you'd ever hear a president-elect say things about US companies like that.\" \"When a company gets considered to be a monopoly by the federal government, that hasn't historically been a bad thing for their stock. If you look at companies, whenever the federal government started considering them to be a monopoly, those have been some pretty big winners in terms of a stock price thereafter,\" the strategist says, highlighting Microsoft's (MSFT) gains since its antitrust woes in the 1990s.
