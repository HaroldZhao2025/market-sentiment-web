NBCUniversal had a similar dispute with YouTube TV earlier this year.Morgan Stanley analysts estimate a 14-day blackout on YouTube TV would cost Disney about $60 million in revenue.The tense discussions underscore YouTube TV's rapid growth - it now has 10 million subscribers - as well as parent company Alphabet's vast financial resources, giving it greater leverage in corporate negotiations.The distribution battle, as well as a quarterly revenue miss, overshadowed some bright spots in Disney's third-quarter results.Those included a profit beat powered by strong growth in the company's streaming and parks businesses.Disney said it added 12.5 million subscribers to Disney+ and Hulu during the quarter, reaching a total of 196 million users.It also unveiled plans to boost its dividend by 50% and double its share buyback plan for fiscal 2026.",
