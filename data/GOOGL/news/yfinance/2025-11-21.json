Soaring valuations in AI stocks this year have stoked worries that Wall Street may be inflating ​another speculative bubble, with some of these fears coming to the fore after a stellar earnings report from AI bellwether Nvidia failed to rally the stock and broader market.  Several high-flying AI stocks have experienced sharp pullbacks, questions are mounting about when AI investments will translate into actual profits, and concerns are growing that enthusiasm may be outpacing the technology's near-‌term capabilities.",
