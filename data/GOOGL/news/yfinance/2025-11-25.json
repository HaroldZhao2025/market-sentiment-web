Investor nervousness has been prevalent recently, with demand for hedges against losses in Big-Tech stocks near the highest since August 2024.  “Seasonality is always an investor’s friend, however it’s important to remember it’s not absolute,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economist and strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management LP.",
