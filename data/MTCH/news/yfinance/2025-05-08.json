    "summary": "(Reuters) -Match Group on Thursday posted a 5% fall in paying users for the first quarter, sending its shares down 7% as investors concerned about the Tinder owner's business revamp looked past its estimate-beating results.  The dating app operator also announced plans to slash 13% of its workforce to cut costs - its first big move since new CEO Spencer Rascoff took the helm in February with a focus on tackling a slowdown in user engagement.  The online dating industry has hit a rough patch as persistent inflation, a lack of innovative features, and market stagnation pull consumers away from dating apps such as Tinder and Bumble.",
