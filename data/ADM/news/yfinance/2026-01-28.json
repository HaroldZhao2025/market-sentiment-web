    "summary": "Archer Daniels Midland agreed to pay $40 million to settle regulatory claims that it defrauded investors by artificially boosting profits at its nutrition business, capping off a scandal that led to the departure of several executives and prompted a huge stock drop when it was disclosed.  The case focuses on a period in 2021 and 2022 when  ADM’s  then-chief financial officer,  Vikram Luthar,  directed accounting adjustments that effectively transferred profits from other ADM segments to the nutrition business, which executives had touted as the company’s “engine for future growth,” the Securities and Exchange Commission said.  The company’s stock dropped 24% the day after it disclosed its own internal investigation into the accounting practices.",
