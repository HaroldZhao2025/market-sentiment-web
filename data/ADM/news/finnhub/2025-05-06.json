    "summary": "CHICAGO (Reuters) -Tariffs and trade chaos stung Archer-Daniels-Midland as the grains merchant on Tuesday posted its weakest first-quarter profit in five years and warned of eroding returns amid U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to redraw global markets.  Slumping sales and weak crop-processing margins slashed operating profit by more than half for ADM's ag services and oilseeds unit, its largest division, more than offseting flat to stronger results in its other business segments.  Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the largest crop importer, are creating a drag for ADM, which has seen its profit erode in recent quarters due to ample global crop supplies and thinning margins.",
