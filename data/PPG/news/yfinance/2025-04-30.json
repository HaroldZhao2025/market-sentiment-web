Shares in paints and coatings company PPG (NYSE: PPG) rose by as much as 6.1% in early trading today as investors cheered its first-quarter earnings report and full-year guidance.  Management reiterated guidance for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.75-$8.05, as an improvement in its performance coatings segment is more than offsetting weakness in other segments.",
