    "summary": "Axon (AXON), alongside Palantir (PLTR) and MicroStrategy (MSTR), is set to join the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). The company, which makes Tasers, police body cams, dash cams, and more, has been one of the best performers in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) since President-elect Donald Trump's reelection. Axon president Josh Isner joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to talk about its Nasdaq inclusion and what's to come for the defense company. Isner says the company's stock being added to the Nasdaq 100 is \"a great milestone for the company\" and \"a great sign of external validation,\" but underlines the company's missions to \"deploy tools into public safety that lead to safer outcomes between police and civilians.\" He adds, \"We're here to serve the United States government however we can.\" The company could benefit from Trump's reelection since the administration has been \"very vocal about the fact that the police need to be refunded, that they're going to be investing in a more secure border.\" Watch the video above to hear more from Isner about Axon.
