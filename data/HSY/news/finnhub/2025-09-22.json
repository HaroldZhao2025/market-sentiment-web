    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Hershey defeated a lawsuit claiming it misled consumers who were disappointed the Halloween-themed Reese's peanut butter candies they bought lacked the decorative details shown on the labels.  U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian ruled on Friday that the plaintiffs did not show they suffered economic harm because their pumpkin-shaped candies, which they thought would contain \"artistic carvings\" of triangular eyes and crooked mouths, were blank.  The May 2024 lawsuit challenged the lack of details on nine Reese's products, including a bat-shaped candy missing eyes, a ghost-shaped candy missing eyes and a mouth, and a football-shaped candy that resembled an egg because it had no stitching.",
