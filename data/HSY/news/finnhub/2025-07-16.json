    "summary": "(Reuters) -Texas' attorney general said on Wednesday he has begun investigating Mars, which makes M&M's and Skittles candies, for its alleged refusal to remove synthetic food dyes from its products.  Ken Paxton, the attorney general, said in a statement that he issued a civil investigative demand for documents from Mars, as he examines whether the family-owned company violated consumers' rights through deceptive trade practices.  Paxton said Mars has not fulfilled its 2016 pledge to remove all artificial colors from food products, saying it had removed \"toxic\" dyes in Europe but not the United States.",
