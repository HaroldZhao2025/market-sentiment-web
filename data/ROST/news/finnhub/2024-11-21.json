Ross Stores expects its annual earnings per share between $6.10 and $6.17, compared with prior forecast of $6.00 to $6.13.  However, the company lowered its fourth-quarter profit forecast, while maintaining its target for comparable sales growth at about 2% to 3% as it attempts to attract consumers deferring big spending on apparel and other non-essential items.",
