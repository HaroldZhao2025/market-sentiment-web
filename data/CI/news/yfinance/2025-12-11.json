    "summary": "With only a few days left before lawmakers leave for their Christmas break and few signs of life in stalled bipartisan negotiations, the failure Thursday of the dueling partisan plans all but guarantees the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits initiated during the pandemic era.  Premium costs on average will more than double for people enrolled in Obamacare plans, forcing many of them to make hard choices on their health coverage and household finances.  The outcome will have wide-ranging consequences for insurance companies, a health-care sector that accounts for one-sixth of the US economy and potentially next year’s midterm elections.",
