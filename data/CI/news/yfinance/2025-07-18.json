    "summary": "(Reuters) -U.S. insurers are requesting the biggest premium increases for Obamacare plans since 2018, according to an analysis by health-research firm KFF, prompted by the looming expiry of premium tax credits and potential tariffs on medical goods.  Insurers are proposing a median premium increase of 15% for 2026, KFF said, citing data from rate filings of 105 insurers across 19 states.  In recent years, premiums in the plans have been relatively flat or grown only modestly.",
