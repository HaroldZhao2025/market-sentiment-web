    "summary": "(Reuters) -Cigna said on Wednesday the percentage of employers paying for obesity drugs has remained flat year-over-year, though the health insurer still sees an uptick in demand for the wildly popular treatments.  More than 50% of its Evernorth unit's clients, a group that includes large employers and health plans, cover the drugs for weight management, Chief Financial Officer Brian Evanko said at the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference.  Within Cigna Healthcare, its health benefits only segment, which caters more to smaller employers, only about 15% to 20% of clients offer coverage of the medications, he said.",
