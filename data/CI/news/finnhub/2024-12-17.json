First, Ados likes Applovin's (APP) EBITDA margins and is bullish on the mobile app's platform revenue growth: \"It's by far the biggest in this category. And the result of it is that app developers are now able to use AI through Applovin to better market their apps, to optimize their their ad campaigns, and to specifically target the right user. That's the only company that offers that. So what's important with this? It's unlike any other AI play, this is an AI play that most people haven't realized that... it's a hidden AI play.\" Health insurance provider Cigna Group (CI) is Ados' goodbye stock as President-elect Donald Trump recently commented he hopes to \"knock out the middleman\" when it comes to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). \"It's hidden through subsidiaries. So it's not that the companies itself are PBMs, but they own other companies inside them that even so, sometimes it's hard for analysts to notice the effect that this... targeting will have to the company overall,\" Ados explains.
