    "summary": "Morning Brief co-hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the latest stock calls on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs analysts has tapped Uber (UBER) as its top stock pick for 2025, with analyst Eric Sheridan highlighting the company's compelling risk-reward profile. Sheridan believes Uber has significant upside potential, driven by its advertising business. Similarly, Morgan Stanley's team has named Apple (AAPL) as a top pick for the coming year, citing artificial intelligence as a key catalyst for an iPhone upgrade cycle. The firm anticipates AI will fuel growth in both sales and gross margins for the tech giant. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has initiated a broad downgrade of homebuilder stocks, including DR Horton (DHI), Toll Brothers (TOL), and Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH). The firm cited a less favorable demand and supply landscape heading into 2025. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.
