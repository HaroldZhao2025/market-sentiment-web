Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) chief economist Mark Palim sits down with Josh Lipton talk about more about pricing trends in the housing market.

We started the year with existing home sales running at 4.2 million; we're ending the year running... around 4 million. So you're seeing the higher rates relative to where they were a few years ago really starting to affect demand.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.
