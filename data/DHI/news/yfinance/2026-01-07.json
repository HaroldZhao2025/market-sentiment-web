        "summary": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 466 points, or 0.9%, from its own record set the day before, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%.  Homebuilders fell sharply, for example, after Trump suggested moves to prevent large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, in hopes of making it more affordable for people to buy houses.  The potential removal from the market of some buyers for homes sent D.R. Horton down 3.6% and PulteGroup 3.2% lower.",
