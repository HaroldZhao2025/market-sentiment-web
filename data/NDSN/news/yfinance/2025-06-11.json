Nordson worked with Powertech Technology, Inc. (PTI) to develop a panel-level packaging (PLP) solution that achieves yields greater than 99% for underfilling during semiconductor manufacturing. PTI is enabling PLP applications that are designed to meet the semiconductor industry’s growing demands to serve AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and chiplet-based architectures. PLP offers a path to managing the complexity of larger die sizes and higher-density designs while maintaining manufacturability and cost efficiency in the transition from 300-mm wafers to panels.",
