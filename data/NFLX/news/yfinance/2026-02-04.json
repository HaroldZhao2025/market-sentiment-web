The first continuing American TV sitcom was the DuMont network’s “Mary Kay and Johnny” in 1947—the same year that also brought the earliest shows geared at children, in “Kukla, Fran and Ollie” and “Howdy Doody.”  This domestic sitcom, starring Lucille Ball as a frustrated housewife and Ball’s then-husband Desi Arnaz as her patient bandleader husband, is the most influential show in TV history, and it isn’t close.",
