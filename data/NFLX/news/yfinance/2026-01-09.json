The shares are currently trading for around 28 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, which is a higher valuation than video streaming rivals like Walt Disney Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc., which owns YouTube, as well as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes.  Paramount Skydance Corp., which also is bidding for Warner Bros. and operates Paramount+, trades for less than 13 times forward earnings.",
