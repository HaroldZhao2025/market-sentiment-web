From hyrox to pickleball, this is a great moment to take a crack at starting a new sports venture. Enter SailGP into the often stodgy world of sailing. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with SailGP CEO and storied yachtsman Russell Coutts. Coutts won an Olympic gold medal in 1984 and then went on to secure several America's Cup victories. In 2019, he co-founded SailGP with Oracle founder and billionaire Larry Ellison. Ellison is a longtime sailing fan. What once began as a fledgling sports league, has gained considerable momentum in terms of viewership and attracting new sponsors. The league now has 13 teams and celebrity team owners such as Hugh Jackman, Ryan Reynolds and Anne Hathaway. Team valuations have also continued to skyrocket, and the business is expected to produce $200 million in sales this year. Coutts shares what the 2026 sailing season holds and what it has been like, transitioning from an athlete to a CEO, piloting the future of a sports league.
