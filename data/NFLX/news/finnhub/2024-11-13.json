MoffettNathanson senior analyst Robert Fishman joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the future of TV. Fishman says from an advertising standpoint, linear TV \"is going to continue to come under significant pressure going forward as the eyeballs continue to shift to the connected TV and streaming landscape.\" However, as far as the distribution goes and figuring out where the pay-TV floor is, \"we are [becoming] increasingly worried about where that floor really is as a lot of the sports rights continue to go over the top.\" Several streamers have pushed into live sports to drive consumers to their streaming services and bundled offerings. As far as what to expect from the media space in the longer term, Fishman says, \"all paths lead back to streaming [as that's] where this industry is going.\" Watch the video above for more on the analyst's expectations for Disney (DIS) earnings, his outlook for media consolidation, and his Netflix (NFLX) valuation.
