      "summary": "Warner Bros. has contractual agreements to release movies in theaters, which Netflix would honor, according to the people, who asked not to be identified revealing details of talks between the companies.  Up to now, Netflix has resisted distributing its movies in theaters, and has grown to rival Hollywood’s largest studios without doing so.  The possibility of owning Warner Bros.’ deep film library, along with the contractual obligations, has softened that opposition.",
