The streaming giant will broadcast the boxing match between social media influencer Jake Paul and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson live on Friday night. Millions are likely to tune in, could more live sports be a catalyst for growth at Netflix? Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Seana Smith speak with Michael Pachter, Wedbush Securities managing director of equity research, about Netflix's future in live programming. \"What broadcast does for Netflix is it allows them to advertise,\" Pachter says. He mentions that one open question he has for Netflix is whether the company will advertise on the rebroadcast of a live program once it's archived, which, Pachter says, is an opportunity for Netflix to make even more money. But not all that glitters is gold. Pachter says that Netflix shouldn't go all in on live sports, telling Yahoo Finance, \"They shouldn't bid for Thursday Night Football or Sunday football. I mean, that's just something that cost them billions of dollars.\" Things like the deal Netflix made with WWE to broadcast RAW and Smackdown, on the other hand, Pachter says, are \"pretty smart.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

      "summary": "It's hard to find a company with more evident competitive advantages yet has performed worse on the stock market over the last decade than Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS).  The entertainment giant has been a household name for nearly a century, and it's been a leader in family entertainment ever since the release of Snow White, its first animated feature film in 1937.  Today, its empire spans ESPN, the properties it gained from the Fox acquisition including Hulu and Hotstar in India, six theme parks around the world that have defined the category, a cruise and vacation business, a large consumer products business that licenses its intellectual property for toys, clothes, and other products, and of course, its core TV and movie business, including ABC, Disney+ and other streaming platforms.",

The intergenerational showdown has all the makings of a crossover hit, with 58-year-old Tyson bringing in the old guard and 27-year-old Paul, who achieved early fame on YouTube, appealing to the younger, screen-toting social media junkies.  Available to all of Netflix's more than 280 million subscribers for no additional fee, it could be a welcome change for American boxing fans accustomed to shelling out extra to watch marquee matches on long-time broadcaster HBO.",
