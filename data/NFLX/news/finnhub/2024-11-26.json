The proposed class action led by a Texas-based trustee began after Netflix revealed in April 2022 it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the prior quarter, the first decline in a decade, and might lose 2 million more in the next three months.  Netflix blamed the decline on several factors, including account sharing, rising competition and a shutdown of service in Russia following the Ukraine invasion.",
