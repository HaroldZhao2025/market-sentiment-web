But they are at the whim of volatile macroeconomic factors that influence capital spending (like interest rates), and the market seems convinced that demand will slow. Due to this bearish outlook, the industry has tumbled by 16.4% over the past six months. This performance was worse than the S&P 500’s 8.7% fall.",
