    "summary": "Amphenol is in a buy zone from a buy point of 70.84 after breaking out on Oct. 23, when the company announced third-quarter results that topped Wall Street expectations.  Although the stock pulled back after its Oct. 23 breakout attempt, it rebounded after touching the 21-day exponential moving average.  The rising relative strength line on an IBD MarketSurge chart shows that the stock is also outperforming the S&P 500 as it finds itself in a buy zone that goes up to 74.38.",
