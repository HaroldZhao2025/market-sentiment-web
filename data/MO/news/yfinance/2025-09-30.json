The company was challenging taxes that it owed for 2017, based on its 10.2% stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev.  \"Against this backdrop, despite Altria’s argument to the contrary, it would be inappropriate for the Court to import any additional 'control' requirement that is not present in the statutory text itself,\" she wrote in rejecting several of the company's arguments.",
