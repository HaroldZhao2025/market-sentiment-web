Tobacco groups, including BAT and Altria, have complained that while waiting years for their own vapes or other products to get permission for sale in the U.S., some vape makers have taken substantial market share even though authorities say they are illegal to sell.  BAT estimated last year that unauthorised disposable vapes account for around 70% of almost 10 billion pounds ($12.93 billion) worth of U.S. vape sales annually.",
