    "summary": "Shares of insurance data analytics provider Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK) fell 1.9% in the afternoon session after its Extreme Event Solutions group announced an estimate for industry-insured losses in Jamaica from Hurricane Melissa, projecting a range between $2.2 billion and $4.2 billion. The estimate covered onshore properties and noted that most of the modeled loss was due to wind damage. This news likely added to investor concerns, as it followed a recent update where Verisk had lowered it",
