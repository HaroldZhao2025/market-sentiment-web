    "summary": "Home Depot (HD) topped its first quarter revenue estimates ($39.86 billion vs. expectations of $39.29 billion) while falling just shy of adjusted earnings estimates ($3.56 vs. estimates of $3.59 per share). Same-store sales declined by 0.3%, more than the 0.2% loss that was expected. On top of all this, the home improvement retailer stated that it doesn't plan to raise prices amid the Trump administration's tariff policies and trade war concerns. D.A. Davidson Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Michael Baker sits down with Catalysts host Madison Mills and her guest host, Tematica Research CIO Chris Versace, to speak more about Home Depot's guidance and earnings expectations for other major retailers.
