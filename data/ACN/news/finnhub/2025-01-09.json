    "headline": "Over 40% of workers are using AI, Accenture reports",
    "summary": "Accenture released new data on AI, which states that more than 40% of employees have incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) into their job functions. The report also notes that many of these workers are worried that employers will think their use of the emerging tech makes them replaceable. Accenture's chief AI officer, Lan Guan, joins Market Domination with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss how the company is leveraging AI across industries. Guan says Accenture is \"an early adopter of AI\" that has \"implemented this kind of AI project across multiple business corporate functions.\" She outlines two instances where the company uses AI: internal marketing campaign management and assisting Accenture's insurance clients with claim processing. Accenture pushes back against the idea that AI will take people's jobs, arguing instead that AI will help humans do their existing work. She says, \"I do believe, even with the most advanced technology ... the future is going to be a very cohesive way of humans and AIs working together.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.
