    "summary": "In today's segment of Good Buy or Goodbye, host Julie Hyman is joined by Jensen Investment Management portfolio manager Kevin Walkush to analyze the most promising stock picks in the artificial intelligence sector. Walkush identifies Accenture (ACN) as his recommended AI investment. He highlights the company's $33 billion commitment to \"tool up\" for AI development, noting that \"they are enabled and ready to deliver AI for their clients\" and \"they are incredibly well-positioned from an investment standpoint.\" He also emphasizes the growth potential in enterprise cloud adoption, pointing out that only 40% of AI enterprises have migrated to cloud infrastructure, leaving a substantial 60% market opportunity. \"You really can't do AI without a cloud,\" Walkush explains, suggesting this untapped demand will significantly benefit Accenture. His third point focuses on the substantial profit potential as AI implementation accelerates. Conversely, Walkush advises against investing in Meta Platforms (META). While acknowledging the tech stock is \"a strong momentum play,\" he warns that market expectations may be unrealistically high, offering limited \"risk mitigation\" for investors. The portfolio manager also points to concerning volatility in recent trading patterns, with leadership's \"direction and focus\" remaining \"uncertain.\" His final concern centers on persistent regulatory and litigation challenges, stating \"We don't think that's going to go away.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.
