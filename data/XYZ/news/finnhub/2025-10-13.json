Goldman analyst Will Nance cut his rating to Sell from Neutral, citing tougher comparisons to last year’s fourth-quarter strong results as well as concerns about the impact of sticky inflation and the weakening job market on less-affluent customers.  PayPal, the owner of Venmo, has struggled this year in what has been a mixed bag for fintech stocks. For example, rival Block has tumbled 11%, but buy-now-pay-later leader  Affirm  and online lender  SoFi  have soared.",
