President Donald Trump's latest policy push is prompting investors to reassess parts of the financial ‌sector, with his emphasis on affordability potentially opening the door for fintech challengers instead of traditional lenders, the brokerage said.  Traditional lenders rallied after Trump's return to the White House in 2025 on expectations of a lighter regulatory touch, but his emphasis on affordability could shift the spotlight ​toward fintech challengers, the note said.",
