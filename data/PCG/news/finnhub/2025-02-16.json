    "summary": "WASHINGTON—A federal clean-energy program fueled by hundreds of billions of dollars during the Biden administration has lost about one-fourth of its staff as part of President Trump’s program to reduce employees across the government.  Roughly 60 employees, including dozens of so-called probationary employees hired in the past few years, have resigned since Trump took office or were fired last week at the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, according to people familiar with the matter.  More cuts are likely to come as the Trump administration’s return-to-work policy kicks in, the people said, with one person estimating that subsequent moves could trim the staff by 50%.",
