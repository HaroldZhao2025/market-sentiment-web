    "summary": "HONG KONG (Reuters) -CK Hutchison said on Monday it was in talks with a consortium pursuing its $22.8 billion ports business to add a Chinese \"major strategic investor\" to the bid, after Beijing flagged a probe into the deal amid heightened Sino-U.S. tension.  The Hong Kong-based conglomerate made the comment the day after exclusive talks ended with the consortium, led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run shipping company MSC.  The parties in March agreed a preliminary deal for 43 ports in 23 countries, including two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal.",
