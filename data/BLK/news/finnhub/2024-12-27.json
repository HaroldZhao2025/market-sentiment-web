    "summary": "The agreement gives the FDIC more ability to monitor Vanguard's investment activities and spells out what is allowed as a passive investor in FDIC-supervised banks.  Its goal was to ensure the largest asset management firms, including Vanguard and BlackRock, do not influence the business decisions of the biggest U.S. banks even when they acquire large stakes via indexed, or passive, investment funds.  In a press release announcing the agreement with Vanguard, Jonathan McKernan, a director of the FDIC, said academic critics have raised concerns about competitive risks of concentrated ownership and the concentration of power in a handful of institutional investors.",
