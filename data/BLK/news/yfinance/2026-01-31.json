Just last week,  BlackRock  disclosed a 19% write-down in the net asset value of the loans owned at  BlackRock TCP Capital  one of the business-development companies that private-credit firms market to individual investors.  Most of the good-sized BDCs have diverse portfolios and credit loss histories that are as good or better than other debt categories.",
