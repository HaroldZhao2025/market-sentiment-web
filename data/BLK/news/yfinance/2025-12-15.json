    "summary": "After a stellar 2025, investors expect shares in European banks to keep heading higher in 2026, supported by strong earnings and, crucially, cost savings stemming from artificial intelligence.  As fears of a recession and interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank have subsided, investors have turned ​even more positive towards European banks, revising up their expectations for the sector, despite a complicated backdrop.  Meanwhile, AI  has emerged as a new force drawing investors to ‌European lenders' shares, partly because a dearth of technology companies in the region has forced many to hunt for AI beneficiaries in old-economy markets.",
