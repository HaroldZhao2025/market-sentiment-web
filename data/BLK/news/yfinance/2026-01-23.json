    "summary": "Yields on short-term US notes have consistently outperformed those on longer-maturity debt over the past year on the assumption that all four finalists for the job would seek the lower borrowing costs Trump has repeatedly sought.  The so-called curve steepener reflects the view that a lower US benchmark makes short-term Treasuries more appealing, but hurts longer-term debt by fanning inflation expectations.  Price pressures may also rise if investors are concerned Trump’s pick will erode Fed independence, with markets potentially offsetting the economic boost from cheaper official rates by pushing up their own borrowing costs.",
