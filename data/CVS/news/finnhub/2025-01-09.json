    "summary": "CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) is a stock that's been struggling badly for multiple years and is coming off a brutal performance in 2024, when its shares nose-dived by 43%.  Investors may have gotten lured into its low, attractive valuation or bought it for its high-yielding dividend, only to end up disappointed later on.  The healthcare company, despite its broad diversification, hasn't provided investors with much safety at all; if you had held the stock for the past three years, your investment would have lost more than half its value.",
