But now, the argument could be made that Chipotle is heading into an interesting five-year period. The company is adding new technology to its restaurants to drive efficiency. It's expanding into new countries such as Mexico. And it’s picking up the pace of new menu offerings. All of this comes as new fast casual restaurant concepts sprout in Chipotle’s backyard.
