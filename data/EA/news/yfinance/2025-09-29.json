    "summary": "Leveraged buyouts are making a strong comeback after years of muted activity, fueled by private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds targeting high-profile technology, media and consumer companies. The resurgence underscores cheap debt markets, abundant dry powder and a search for stable cash flows amid public market volatility, culminating in deals such as the proposed $55 billion takeover of Electronic Arts by Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners. A leveraged buyout, or LBO, is a deal in which a company is acquired largely with borrowed money.",

For PIF, Saudi Arabia's $1 trillion wealth fund, the investment is a massive opportunity to push ahead with efforts to become a global hub for games and sports, as it bets on the enduring value of blockbuster game franchises as the industry recovers from a prolonged downturn.",
