The deal underscores the increasing demand for narrowbody aircraft as global travel surges, though production challenges, including workers' strike, regulatory scrutiny, and supply pressures, threaten to cause delivery delays.  Boeing and BOC Aviation did not disclose the details of the deal, while Airbus did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.",
