The deal enables Boeing to avoid being branded a convicted felon and to escape oversight from an independent monitor for three years that was part of a plea deal struck in 2024 to a criminal fraud charge that it misled U.S. regulators about a crucial flight control system on the 737 MAX, its best-selling jet.

      "summary": "(Reuters) -Boeing and the Justice Department on Wednesday asked a U.S. judge to approve an agreement that allows the company to avoid prosecution despite objections from relatives of some of the 346 people killed in two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019.  The deal enables Boeing to avoid being branded a convicted felon and to escape oversight from an independent monitor for three years that was part of a plea deal struck in 2024 to a criminal fraud charge that it misled U.S. regulators about a crucial flight control system on the 737 MAX, its best-selling jet.  Boeing argued the executive branch solely has the power to decide whether to bring or maintain a prosecution.",
