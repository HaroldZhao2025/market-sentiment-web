      "summary": "STORY: Boeing is reportedly in the early stages of developing a new single-aisle airplane that would eventually replace the 737 MAX.The Wall Street Journal reported the development on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.And Boeing did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment.The 737 MAX entered service in 2017 but was grounded globally in 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.The incidents slashed Boeing's profits and triggered lawsuits, investigations, and a criminal probe.The Federal Aviation Administration lifted the grounding order in 2020 during the pandemic.Last Friday, the FAA said it would allow the planemaker to issue airworthiness certificates for some 737 MAX jets, starting this week.According to the Wall Street Journal report, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg met with officials from Rolls-Royce Holdings in the UK earlier this year to discuss a new engine for the aircraft.Rolls-Royce declined to comment on Monday's report. Boeing also still faces regulatory scrutiny.Last year, the FAA imposed a production cap of 38 per month for 737 MAX planes.That was after a mid-air cabin panel blowout on a new Alaska Airlines jet, which was later found to be missing four bolts.That incident led the U.S. Justice Department, under former President Joe Biden, to open a criminal investigation.",
