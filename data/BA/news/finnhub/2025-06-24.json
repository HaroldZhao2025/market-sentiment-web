Taiwan's oldest airline, established in 1959, is in the midst of a fleet renewal, last year splitting an order for new long-haul aircraft worth almost $12 billion at list prices between Boeing and European rival Airbus.  China Airlines has also ordered 24 Boeing 787s for regional and some longer-distance routes, including 18 787-9s and six of the stretched 787-10 variant.",
