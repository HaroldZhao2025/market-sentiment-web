In the energy sector, Cho highlights Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM), emphasizing that they \"really have valuation potential.\" She is closely watching companies like Boeing (BA), which she notes has \"taken a hit\" recently. In healthcare, she points to Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) as a stock that has \"been a favorite of ours for quite a while.\" Regarding Boeing, Cho believes the company has overcome significant challenges, including safety concerns and strikes. With these issues now \"in the rearview mirror,\" she sees the airplane manufacturer focusing on cleaning up its operations and addressing production challenges. \"I do feel that they're on the path to do that, and if they continue that, then that potentially could be very good for the stock,\" she added. Cho finds the biotech space particularly exciting, highlighting the increased innovation, especially in minimally invasive implants. \"These are things that are just revolutionary,\" she remarked. Cho anticipates significant growth in the energy sector driven by AI's increasing energy demands. As artificial intelligence expands, it will require \"an immense amount of energy,\" positioning the energy sector to benefit substantially from this trend.
