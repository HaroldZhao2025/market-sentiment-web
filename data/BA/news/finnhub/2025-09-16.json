    "summary": "Striking workers at Boeing Defense will vote on Friday on a four-year contract proposed by their union in an effort to end a six-week strike, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said on Tuesday.  Boeing, however, said the proposal was a waste of time and would prolong the work stoppage in the St. Louis area and nearby Illinois, where the striking workers assemble Boeing's fighter jets, munitions, other military aircraft and wing components for the 777X airliner.  IAM District 837's roughly 3,200 members voted by 57% to reject that earlier offer on September 12.",
