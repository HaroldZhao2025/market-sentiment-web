Bancroft emphasizes that Boeing's priorities should lie in restoring safe and efficient production operations. \"I think as long as you're seeing the trajectory going positive, that's gonna be a good sign for Boeing,\" he tells Yahoo Finance, identifying this as a key to the company's stock recovery in 2025. Analyzing Boeing's business divisions, Bancroft highlights the aircraft manufacturer's strong competitive advantage in defense manufacturing, specifically citing the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus and P-8A anti-submarine aircraft. However, he notes that Boeing lacks similar advantages in its space program. Regarding the company's various initiatives, Bancroft suggests Boeing needs to critically evaluate its portfolio, asking \"What's the profitability of this program?\" Watch the video above for Bancroft's outlook on the impact of the upcoming Trump administration's policies on the aircraft maker.
