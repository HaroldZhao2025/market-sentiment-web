    "summary": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Friday said he will hold an August 28 hearing on a request by the Justice Department and Boeing to approve an agreement that allows the planemaker to avoid prosecution on a charge stemming from two fatal 737 MAX plane crashes that killed 346 people.  The deal, which faces objections from relatives of some of those killed in the crashes in 2018 and 2019, enables Boeing to escape oversight from an independent monitor for three years.  Boeing last year agreed to plead guilty under a deal with prosecutors to a criminal fraud charge that it misled U.S. regulators about a crucial flight control system on the 737 MAX, its best-selling jet.",
