On this episode of Trader Talk, Kenny Polcari breaks down why he sees AI as a Fourth Industrial Revolution, not a replay of the dot-com bubble, and explains how real cash flows and productivity gains set today’s leaders apart from the 2000s hype. He’s joined by hedge fund manager Tom Hayes of Great Hill Capital, who unpacks how crowded the AI trade has become, why retail options buying may be a red flag, and where he sees second-derivative winners in names like Alibaba (BABA), Intel (INTC), and Boeing (BA). Together, they delve into FOMO, volatility, and how disciplined investors can utilize fundamentals and time arbitrage to navigate the shakeout and still capitalize on AI’s long-term upside.
