    "summary": "(Reuters) -Take-Two Interactive raised its annual bookings forecast on Thursday, betting on strong demand for its new \"Mafia\" and \"Borderlands\" titles, sending its shares up 5% in extended trading.  The firm stuck to the May 26 launch date for its highly awaited \"Grand Theft Auto VI,\" which is expected to generate billions of dollars within weeks of its release.  Take-Two is banking on \"Mafia: The Old Country\", \"Borderlands 4\" and its core sports titles to drive growth in the absence of \"Grand Theft Auto VI\" against the backdrop of industry-wide struggles with challenging economic conditions.",
