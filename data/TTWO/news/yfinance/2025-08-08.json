That left investors waiting for payoffs from mobile gaming deals such as Take-Two's 2022 buyout of Zynga for $12.7 billion.  But Take-Two's raised annual forecast and better-than-expected results for the April-June period offered the clearest sign yet that the U.S. mobile-gaming market was bouncing back.",
