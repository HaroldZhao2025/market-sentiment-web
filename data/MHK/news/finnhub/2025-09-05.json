    "summary": "Shares of home builders and suppliers were rising Friday following a lackluster U.S. jobs report for August that sent bond yields lower and raised expectations for rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.  The U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, well below the 76,500 economists had expected, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2% in July.  In turn, Wall Street’s bets on a rate cut in September rose to 100% from 96.4%, and the share of a half-point cut rose to 14.3% from zero, according to CME FedWatch.",
