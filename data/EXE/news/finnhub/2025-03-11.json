President Donald Trump has ratcheted up tariffs on his country's northern neighbor, although Canadian oil and gas exports to the U.S. have so far received fewer penalties.  The tensions should instigate fresh thinking to boost Canadian energy exports, especially of liquefied natural gas, to other countries, according to Kimmeridge managing partner Mark Viviano.",
