    "summary": "Kimmeridge Energy Management will pursue more activism among Canadian oil and gas producers, a senior executive told Reuters on Tuesday, as it targets underperforming companies and potential benefits emanating from the trade war with the United States.  President Donald Trump has ratcheted up tariffs on his country's northern neighbor, although Canadian oil and gas exports to the U.S. have so far received fewer penalties.  The tensions should instigate fresh thinking to boost Canadian energy exports, especially of liquefied natural gas, to other countries, according to Kimmeridge managing partner Mark Viviano.",
