    "summary": "My mom and I were about to spend six days crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a 4,200-passenger cruise ship—at the tail end of hurricane season.  Potentially rough seas and the hazards they present are part of the gamble when you take the long way home from Europe.  Most cruise lines offer trans-Atlantic cruises just once a year in each direction to get their ships positioned for the season (Caribbean in winter, Europe in summer).",
