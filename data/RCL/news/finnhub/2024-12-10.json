Host Brad Smith to discuss his market outlook for the new year and how investors can position their portfolios. The portfolio manager expects an initial pullback in 2025 and then a return to growth. \"I think pretty much all areas of the market are going to probably feel the pain [of the pullback],\" Pavlik says, noting, \"I'd use that as, actually, a buying opportunity.\" The portfolio manager highlights names like Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Royal Caribean Cruises (RCL), AJ Gallagher (AJG), United Rentals (URI), Eaton (ETN), and Salesforce (CRM) as stocks to buy at discount during the 2025 pullback. \"I wouldn't be buying it now, but I think you have to make a list. Just like going to the grocery store. You have to be prepared as to what to buy ... [and] look for bargains when they come up,\" Pavlik says.
