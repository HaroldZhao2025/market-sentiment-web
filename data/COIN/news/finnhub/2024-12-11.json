Coincheck Group Executive Chairman Oki Matsumoto joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the company's growth strategy following this milestone. Matsumoto explains that Coincheck is a cryptocurrency exchange platform in Japan, boasting over 2 million individual customers domestically. The company's strategic plan is to leverage its newly public status to \"acquire our competitors in Japan and also acquire similar businesses around the globe.\" Matsumoto is also the chairman and founder of the Monex Group (8698.T, MNXBF). The NASDAQ listing provides Coincheck with the opportunity to \"really expand\" the business, positioning them as only the second cryptocurrency exchange to go public, alongside Coinbase (COIN).
