Asymmetric founder, CEO, and CIO Joe McCann joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss his view that bitcoin will jump to $100,000 under Trump. \"There's a number of actual structural market forces at play right now behind the price of bitcoin,\" McCann says, naming Trump's unexpectedly winning the popular vote and the red sweep. \"Given the amount of momentum that the Trump administration has from the crypto industry and its support, you're actually seeing, I think, a lot of buying outside of the United States as well, even though primarily the majority of the buying has been US-based and the reason is the strategic bitcoin reserve that they've actually floated.\" Watch the video above for more about what Trump's second term means for crypto regulation and the US government's crypto approach.
