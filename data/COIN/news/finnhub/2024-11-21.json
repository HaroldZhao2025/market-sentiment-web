Market Domination Host Julie Hyman joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to break down the disparity. Fundstrat Global Advisors head of digital asset strategy Sean Farrell explains, \"There are certain capital controls in South Korea that do not allow for differences in price on Korean exchanges to be carved away, and therefore you can get severe deviations, especially during speculative periods of any market cycle where the price of bitcoin on Korean exchanges is sometimes 5%, 10%, 15%, up to 50% higher than it is, say, on Coinbase (COIN) or Binance (BNB-USD).
