Among elements of the bill Coinbase and other firms are lashing out against are limits on their ability to offer yield or rewards on customers’ stablecoin holdings.  After their success helping get Trump elected and the stablecoin bill passed, crypto executives now fear the impasse over tokens pegged to the dollar could prevent the US regulatory framework from catching up with other markets.",
