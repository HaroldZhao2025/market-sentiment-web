    "summary": "Opening Bid Unfiltered is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. Just like that, the crypto bears have resurfaced. The fall has brought a bear market for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Experts cite a range of factors. For one, the Fed's lack of enthusiasm for a December rate cut has reduced investors' risk appetite. Crypto is still one of the riskiest assets in the game. And two, a questionable presidential pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has cast new scrutiny on the cast of characters continuing to linger in the crypto space. How long will the bear market continue? Have institutions lost interest in crypto after a year of significant upside catalysts? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Coinbase (COIN) head of institutional strategy John D’Agostino. D’Agostini takes Sozzi inside the latest thinking of institutions on crypto and stock, and what 2026 may hold for the industry. Listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website for full episodes of Opening Bid Unfiltered. Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered is produced by Langston Sessoms.",
