        "summary": "Nine pharmaceutical companies including Merck and GSK agreed to lower certain U.S. prices for their medicines in a new round of industry pacts with the Trump administration.  The companies agreed to reduce U.S. prices on drugs to levels comparable with prices charged in other wealthy countries, which are generally much lower.  Merck, for example, said it would make diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet available to eligible American patients at a cash price that is 70% off the current list price through a direct-to-patient program.",
