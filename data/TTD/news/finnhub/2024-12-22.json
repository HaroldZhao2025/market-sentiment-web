As the name implies, the index holds 500 of the top U.S. large-cap stocks.  In order to join it, a company must be based in the U.S., be profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis over its last four quarters, and have a \"large-cap\" market cap, generally meaning above $10 billion.",
