    "summary": "Although the market rebounded sharply on Wednesday on news that President Trump was pausing tariffs and only levying a flat 10% rate, except for China, the Nasdaq is still in a bear market.  Bear markets start when an index drops 20% from its all-time high and technically remain in bear market status until a new all-time high is reached, which then kicks off a bull market.  Regardless of the technical definition of a bear market, there are still plenty of bargains to be scooped up right now, and I think investors should still be buying.",
