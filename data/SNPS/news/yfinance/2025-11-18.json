(NASDAQ: SNPS), alongside technical collaborators at Microsoft Ignite, today unveiled a simulation-driven framework for optimizing dynamic manufacturing processes in real time. First deployed by Krones, a leader in fully integrated packaging and bottling line systems, the framework was used to create a physically accurate virtual assembly line with optimization outputs accounting for critical variables, such as bottle shape, liquid viscosity, and fill level.",
