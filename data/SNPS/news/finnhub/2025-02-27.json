    "summary": "Software company Synopsys (SNPS) continues to show strong performance, with a beat on first quarter fiscal year earnings and a reaffirmed outlook for double-digit revenue growth. The company's focus remains on its artificial intelligence (AI)-driven reinvention of computing, particularly in design activities. Synopsys CEO and President Sassine Ghazi joins Market Domination hosts Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman to discuss how the AI revolution is impacting industries. \"Like any disruptive technology — and AI is absolutely one of the mega trends that will drive a completely different change in many end market applications workflows — it started with big investments in data centers and infrastructure build-out,\" Ghazi says. While AI and high-performance computing remain robust, smart technology in other sectors like automotive and industrial face challenges, with recovery expected by late 2025. Ghazi also addresses ongoing headwinds in China. \"What we communicated actually yesterday, as we're reaffirming the guidance for the year, is these headwinds are going to continue, and the deceleration will continue to below corporate average due to two factors,\" he explains. These factors Ghazi notes are the cumulative effect of restrictions slowing down chip activities, particularly for high-end chips in China, and the ongoing macroeconomic challenges within China itself.
