Synopsys software helps engineers figure out how to arrange tens of billions of transistors, the tiny electrical switches that make computers work.  That already complex task has gotten more complicated in recent years as companies such as Nvidia, a Synopsys customer, shift from designing single chips to AI server systems with hundreds or even thousands of chips in them while aiming to release a new server each year.",
