        "summary": "IBM will partner with Cisco Systems to build a network of \"large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers\" by early next decade, the companies announced Thursday.  Both IBM stock and Cisco shares were higher as Nvidia's earnings report lifted tech stocks more broadly.  The Dow Jones giants will collaborate on what IBM called networked distributed quantum computing, allowing powerful quantum computers to work together to run computations over a massive scale.",
