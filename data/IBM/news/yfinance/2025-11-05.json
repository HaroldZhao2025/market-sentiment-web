On this episode of Trader Talk, Kenny Polcari breaks down how the 2026 midterm elections, government shutdown drama, and policy shocks surrounding tariffs, healthcare, EV credits, and rare earth metals can cause entire sectors to be slammed overnight, while long-term investors stay focused on fundamentals. Then Schwab Network lead market technician Richard Ducat joins to map out where the real action is in AI and quantum computing, from legacy names like IBM to up-and-coming chip and automation plays. They wrap with a look at gold versus bitcoin, what the rush into alternative assets says about market fear, and how traders can keep their portfolios disciplined when headlines go off the rails.
