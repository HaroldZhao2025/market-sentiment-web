    "summary": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -New Mexico, site of the world's first atomic bomb tests, on Tuesday plans to invest $315 million in a bid to become a leader in another potentially era-defining technology: quantum computing.  Quantum computing, which leverages the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and sub-atomic scale, holds the promise of solving in minutes some problems that would take conventional computers thousands of years.  New Mexico will invest $315 million in private companies, fabrication facilities and other infrastructure such as a quantum network to connect labs and businesses.",
