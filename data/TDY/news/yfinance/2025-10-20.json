The detectors will be fielded across the U.S. to help CBP identify the most challenging drug samples, such as those containing fentanyl in extremely low concentrations. The Griffin G510x has proven uniquely capable of confirming lethal narcotics ‘hidden’ within other substances and cutting agents, where they are commonly missed by other field portable devices.",
