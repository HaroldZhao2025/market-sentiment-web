FLIR Defense is lead integrator in modernizing the NBCRV sensor suite system with an improved and autonomous suite of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) sensors. Among other third-party solutions, the Sensor Suite features the FLIR Defense R80D SkyRaider™ drone integrated with FLIR’s MUVE™ B330 biological detection payload designed for small unmanned aerial systems. Also, a FLIR-developed command and control system combines all devices and platforms with sensor fusion and automation features that reduce cognitive burden and improve decision-making.
