The systems provide operators with high-definition daylight, low light, and infrared imagery and will be used in support of all Coast Guard missions, with an emphasis on search and rescue, living marine resources, and law enforcement. The new technology also will augment coastal security, drug and migrant interdiction, ports and waterways protection, and other Coast Guard rapid response needs. (Photo: Business Wire)",
