Improvements include a 50% increase in Black Hornet’s radio communications range from two to three kilometers. The BH4’s new Android tablet now has up to twice the battery life, plus a battery heater for charging in cold temperatures. The new tablet also features improved ergonomics, making it easier to use while wearing gloves. Black Hornet 4 represents the next generation of lightweight nano-drones, able to provide enhanced covert situational awareness to small fighting units. Its 12-megapixel daytime camera and high-resolution thermal imager deliver crisp video and still images to the operator. At just 70 grams, Black Hornet 4 can fly for over 30 minutes and more than three kilometers.",
