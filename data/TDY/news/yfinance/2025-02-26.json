The $15 million contract was facilitated by Teledyne FLIR’s regional partner, European Logistic Partners (ELP) GmbH of Wuppertal, Germany. Black Hornet 4 represents the next generation of lightweight nano-drones, able to provide enhanced covert situational awareness to small fighting units. It delivers crisp thermal/visual imagery to operators. At just 70 grams, Black Hornet 4 can fly for over 30 minutes, more than two kilometers, and function in 25-knot winds and rain.
