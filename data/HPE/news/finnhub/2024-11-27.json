    "summary": "Dell Technologies (DELL) and HPE (HPE) shares are selling off after the PC makers reported quarterly results. TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss three things he believes will send PC maker stocks higher in 2025. \"I think [2025] is the year where we see a lot of this happen.

And that four-plus year time frame is when there's typically a refresh anyway.\" \"Number two, we have the transition to Windows 11 being driven by the end of support for Windows 10, and that's happening again in 2025,\" and lastly, \"the move to the AI PC.\" The analyst says, given these three driving factors, \"You've got a lot of businesses [that are going to have to refresh their PCs in [2025], and that's going to help both Dell and HP.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.
