The agreement shows how FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson is carrying out President Donald Trump's agenda through enforcement actions, and finding ways to address conservative grievances against big corporations through the antitrust laws.  The agreement with the agency would still allow individual advertisers to specify where their ads are shown, the FTC said.",
