    "summary": "(Reuters) -Investors will zoom in on Nike's marketing plans for the coming year when it reports results on Tuesday, after several sluggish quarters in which rivals have stolen market share and high tariffs have hit imported goods.  The company, in the midst of a turnaround under CEO Elliott Hill, showed an appetite for big-ticket ad campaigns in the year ended May - boosting its marketing spend to $1.63 billion, up 9% from the previous year - and next year brings one of the biggest sports marketing bonanzas of the decade: the World Cup.  Marketing plans around the Cup, which will be held next June in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will be a main investor focus in the coming months, Morningstar analyst David Swartz said.",
