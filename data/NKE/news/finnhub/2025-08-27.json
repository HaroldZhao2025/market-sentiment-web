The sportswear retailer, which makes nearly 40% of its revenue in the United States through its JD Sports, Hibbett, DTLR and Shoe Palace stores, said like-for-like sales for its second quarter to August 2 fell 3.0%, having been down 2.0% in the first quarter.  Shares in FTSE 100-listed JD have lost a third of their value over the last 12 months, reflecting a market driven by discounts, a drop-off in demand for Nike products, which account for about 45% of its sales, and uncertainty over the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on costs and consumer demand.",
