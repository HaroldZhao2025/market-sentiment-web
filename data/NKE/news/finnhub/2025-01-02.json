    "summary": "On a recent episode of Opening Bid, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi discussed the 2025 outlook for retail with BMO Capital Markets Managing Director & Senior Analyst Simeon Siegel, Mastercard Economics Institute Chief Economist Michelle Meyer, and Barclays Consumer Discretionary Senior Analyst Adrienne Yih. Two big names in the discussion: Nike and Gap. Siegel made the call that Nike (NKE) will have a rebound in 2025, now that Elliott Hill is their new CEO. \"It's not going to be a quick seamless fix. But this is a business that has the largest marketing budget in the world, right? When Nike wants to win, when they're ready to win, when they have the product to win, the storytelling will follow.\" Though Yih agreed, she suggested there are other stocks that are a better play such as Foot Locker (FL) or Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). Yih also expects a turnaround in the new year for Gap (GAP) because of Richard Dickson, who joined the company as CEO in August 2023. She explained that Mickey Drexler—another recent Opening Bid guest— was the last brand/product marketing CEO, which will be good for the business again. \"That's the last time you had a merchant brand-led organization. We are very bullish on Gap for next year and for a couple of years ahead.\" For full episodes of Opening Bid, watch on our website or listen on your favorite podcast platform.
