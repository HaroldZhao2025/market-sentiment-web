    "summary": "Bill Ackman is calling for a 90-day pause on the implementation of President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs.  “I have a lot of respect for our president and what he has accomplished so far, but I don’t think he is infallible, which is why I am stating loud and clear that I strongly believe launching tariffs on April 9th against the entire world — massively in excess of what we are being charged — is a mistake,” said Ackman in a post on the social-media platform X.  In another post earlier in the day, Ackman warned about “a self-induced, economic nuclear winter” if President Trump doesn’t pause the tariffs to prevent further economic fallout.",
