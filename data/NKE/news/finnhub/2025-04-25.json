In a proposed class action filed in Brooklyn, New York federal court, purchasers led by Australian resident Jagdeep Cheema said the sudden closure in December of Nike's RTFKT unit caused demand for their NFTs to dry up.  They said they would never have bought the NFTs at the prices they did, or at all, had they known the tokens were unregistered securities, and that Nike would \"cause the rug to be pulled out from under them.\"",
