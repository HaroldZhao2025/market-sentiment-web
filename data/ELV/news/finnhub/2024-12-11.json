The suspect of last week's fatal shooting, Luigi Mangione, has been charged with Thompson's murder after being arrested in Altoona, PA on Monday. As more information comes out, NYPD investigators have already deemed the assassination to be a \"pre-meditated [and] pre-planned, targeted attack.\" Anomaly CEO Mike Desjadon sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills to have a conversation about the complexities and greatest challenges Americans face in navigating the healthcare system.  \"So often in healthcare... behind the scenes, there's this whole industry figuring out what to bill and whom to bill. That part of healthcare costs a half a trillion dollars a year, and it's done wrong more than 20% of the time,\" Desjadon explains. \"So to you, you might not get a bill, you might get a bill. And if you do, that bill might be $4 [or] it might be $84,000. And you really have no idea why or know where to turn.\" Oscar Health (OSCR) CEO Mark Bertolini previously told Yahoo Finance earlier this week that the healthcare system \"has been broken for some time\" as this tragic event has been \"a wake-up call for the industry.\" Desjadon goes on to compare the public and private healthcare sectors and how to simplify the system for the insured.
