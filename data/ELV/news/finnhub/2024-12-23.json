The suspected gunman, Luigi Mangione, has been charged with several counts of murder and even terrorism, which he pleaded not guilty to on Monday. In the aftermath of this event, Americans have expressed an outcry over their frustrations with dealing with health insurance providers and maneuvering the cracks in the US healthcare system. Center for Health and Democracy (CHD) President Wendell Potter joins Market Domination's Josh Lipton and Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani to speak more about his self-described \"crisis of conscience\" when he worked within the health industry. Potter penned a New York Times op-ed piece last week titled I Was a Health Insurance Executive. What I Saw Made Me Quit. \"I became aware of the barriers that health insurance companies have put in place to assure their profitability, but that have resulted in more and more Americans not being able to get the care that they need, medically necessary care, even with insurance,\" the former Cigna (CI) vice president of communications explains. \"Those barriers that that they put in place to assure profitability and shareholder return really made me walk away. I used to handle financial communications for Cigna, my name was on all of the company's quarterly reports for ten years.

    "headline": "Healthcare concerns rise as insurers deny patient claims",
    "summary": "Health insurance claim denials continue to be a significant challenge in the US healthcare system. When insurers reject claims, doctors and hospitals face delays in reimbursement for their services, often leading them to postpone patient care until procedures or treatments receive proper authorization. Recent Medicare data reveals that the industry average for denied claims has reached 17%, with UnitedHealthcare (UNH) showing the highest denial rate at 33%. Yahoo Finance Senior Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani examines this issue, highlighting automation and artificial intelligence as one of the driving forces behind high denial rates. She discusses implications for healthcare providers and patients, and shares three tips to fight claim denials: 1) never pay the first bill, 2) fight with insurer for coverage, and 3) ask for cash pay options.  To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.
