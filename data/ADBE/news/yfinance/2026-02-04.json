        "description": "",
        "summary": "European and U.S. software stocks struggled to find support on Wednesday as a sector-wide selloff spread to Asia, fuelled by mounting worries that advances in artificial intelligence could upend companies' business ​models.  European data analytics, professional services and software stocks fell for a second day in volatile trade, mirroring losses in ‌global peers, after Anthropic's new legal artificial intelligence model underscored the threat to businesses seen as most exposed to AI disruption.  Shares of U.S. software and services firms were mixed in premarket trading after a near 13% slide over five straight sessions.",
