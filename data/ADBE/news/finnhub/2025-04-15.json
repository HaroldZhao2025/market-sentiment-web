    "summary": "(Reuters) -Cloud-based designer platform Figma on Tuesday confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the United States, more than a year after a $20 billion deal to be acquired by Adobe was shelved due to regulatory roadblocks.  Figma had been widely considered as a candidate to go public after antitrust regulators in Europe and Britain blocked Adobe's deal in December 2023 in what would have been one of the biggest acquisitions of a software startup.  Last year, Figma was valued at $12.5 billion after it closed a deal to allow its employees and early investors to sell their stake to new and existing investors.",
