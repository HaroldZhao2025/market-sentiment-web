Before it was known as Tapestry (TPR) and an owner of the Coach and Kate Spade Brands, Coach was just Coach — maker of handbags and accessories that dominated mall racks. But like with every retailer in business for decades, Coach has stories to tell. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with former longtime Coach CEO Lew Frankfort. Frankfort is out with a new memoir called \"Bag Man: The Story Behind the Improbable Rise of Coach.\" The book takes readers inside the history of the accessories maker founded in New York City in 1941. Frankfurt joined the company in 1979 with no background in the fashion industry. By 1985, he was the president of Coach, CEO by 1995, and then led the company’s IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2000. He departed Coach as CEO in January 2014, but has stayed close to the company and the broader retail industry. Frankfort shares his journey through the C-suite and the lessons he learned along the way.
