    "summary": "The holiday shopping season has arrived, kicking off with Black Friday promotions and deals being pushed by companies across industries. Former LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY) Chairman of North America Pauline Brown joins Morning Brief to discuss consumer shopping patterns, particularly in the luxury goods sector. Brown notes a generational divide in shopping habits: older consumers are more than 50% likely to shop online and research products before visiting stores. In contrast, younger generations prefer in-store shopping, as \"it's become a social activity again.\" However, luxury brand prices remain a significant concern for consumers. \"This is not an issue that has just come to the fore this holiday season, this has been going on for about 5 years,\" Brown tells Yahoo Finance, noting that price inflation has exceeded 50% \"for most luxury brands.\" She highlights two key factors driving this inflation: growing appetite for luxury brands which \"seemed to be permission to raise the price,\" and previously strong growth in China, a key consumer market that has begun to see slowing demand for luxury goods.
