    "summary": "(Reuters) -Data storage provider Western Digital has convinced a California federal judge to reduce a $552.7 million award against it in a patent dispute over data encryption to just $1, according to a court order made public on Monday. U.S. District Judge James Selna said the award for patent licensing company SPEX Technologies wrongly included damages for aspects of Western Digital's products that did not infringe the patent, wiping out a $315.7 million jury verdict plus an additional $237 million that he had previously determined Western Digital owed SPEX in interest. San Jose, California-based SPEX was originally formed to license technology from Spyrus, a cryptography company that developed technology for encrypting sensitive communications.",
