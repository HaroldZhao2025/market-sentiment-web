    "summary": "The firm asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to add an additional trading session, from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. ET, according to a filing Monday.  “This evolution reflects a simple reality: global investors expect access on their terms, in their time zones, without compromising trust or market integrity,” Chuck Mack, senior vice president of North American markets at Nasdaq, said in an emailed statement.  The exchange joins peers in touting growing interest in trading US stocks outside of traditional market hours, which run from 9:30 a.m. ET to 4 p.m. Market participants outside US trading welcomed the potential for faster pricing on earnings and macroeconomic developments, though they cautioned that near-continuous trading would give investors less time to digest after-hours headlines and may lead to more extreme swings during hours when liquidity is thin.",
