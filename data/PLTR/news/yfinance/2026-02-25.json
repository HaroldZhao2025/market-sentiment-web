Polymarket users have bet on whether the US would strike Iran on a particular date, whether a given Trump cabinet member would be the first to leave office and whether Jesus Christ would return before 2027. Bloomberg Businessweek Contributor Chris Beam joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. He speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.",
