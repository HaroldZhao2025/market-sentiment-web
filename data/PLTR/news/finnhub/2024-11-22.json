    "summary": "Investors are divided, and it depends on their feelings around President-elect Donald Trump's reelection, Procyon Partners financial advisor Jerry Sneed tells Wealth! Host Brad Smith. \"Clients are still very much polarized from the election. It's either 'Trump's in, we got to buy,' or it's Trump's in, I'm really anxious, we got to go to cash.' So, I've been doing a lot of counterbalancing based on their opinion,\" Sneed says. The financial advisor explains, \"The bulls, I've been kind of walking back a little bit, and the bears have been kind of hyping up a little bit, [since] our base case is we're optimistic. We just think there's going to be a lot of chop because, essentially, we don't know the rules of the game yet. We know what the administration ran on, what they campaigned on, but we don't know where they're going to start or how that's going to ripple through the economy.\" Watch the video above for more on Sneed's advice for investors positioning for Trump's upcoming second term and his views on stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR).
