    "summary": "All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) rebound from a selloff fueled by the Federal Reserve's 2025 forecast coming in more hawkish than expected. Haywood Wealth Management president and co-founder Justin Haywood joins Wealth! Host Brad Smith to break down what investors should consider when positioning their portfolio. \"I would call yesterday's move a hawkish cut,\" Haywood says, adding, \"I think the Fed was probably reluctant to make this cut. They may have backed themselves into a corner in a sense with their rhetoric in September. And I think they felt like they needed to make this cut.\" Looking forward to 2025, he says, \"the sentiment should be relatively bullish\" despite uncertainty around President-elect Donald Trump's policies. \"You want to ride this out,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. Haywood outlines his top picks, saying, \"Technology remains a strong play moving into 2025.\" He names Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR).
