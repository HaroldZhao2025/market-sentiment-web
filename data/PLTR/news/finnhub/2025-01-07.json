    "summary": "Rational Equity Armor Fund portfolio manager Joe Tigay joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to outline his three stock picks that could gain under Trump's second term in the White House: Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), and Palantir (PLTR). Tigay notes that Tesla is a leader in the world of electric vehicles (EVs) and is likely to receive favorable treatment from the new presidential administration. This may be bolstered by the fact that reduced EV spending overall is anticipated under Trump 2.0, positioning Tesla to be the winner of the sector. Beyond Tesla's EVs, Tigay highlights the company's battery sector as a promising revenue stream in the future. \"I think that's going to be a big player going forward in the next four years,\" he says. , among other signs that Bezos has been fostering an amicable relationship with the president-elect. These moves note a shift from the historical feud between Bezos and Trump.Amazon is another one of Tigay's top picks, partly due to Jeff Bezos' recent financial support of Trumphttps://finance.yahoo.com... \"It seems like Amazon, this time around, is attempting to be on more favorable conditions,\" Tigay explains. \"In general, Amazon wants to have a favorable relationship with this administration because there's big money to be had, specifically in the cloud services.\" He adds that Amazon may be better positioned for upcoming tariffs and expected tax reductions. Tigay's third top pick is Palantir, which he describes as \"the software innovation of the AI world.\" The company had a significant run-up after the election, receives a lot of government business, and has the right products to \"put AI to work.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
