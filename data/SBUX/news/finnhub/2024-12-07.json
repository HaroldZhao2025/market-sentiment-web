    "headline": "Starbucks CEO has 'tall order' ahead: Shake Shack founder",
    "summary": "Pun intended by Shake Shack (SHAK) founder and Union Square Hospitality Group CEO Danny Meyer, when he said on a recent episode of Opening Bid with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, that Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Brian Niccol has a \"tall order\" ahead of him; a witty reference to the smallest coffee cup size and incredibly large undertaking for the newest CEO. The legendary restaurateur explained that it's not necessarily advantageous to have every permutation of a coffee available to its customers in the name of \"saying yes\" for good hospitality. \"The average customer may have a declining good experience because of all the hospitality we're giving saying 'yes'....I guarantee you that Starbucks is gonna find a way to say 'yes', but they're not going to promote all those alternatives the way they once did. Because I think all those alternatives gum up the works for the average person who just wants a tall coffee,\" Meyer said.
