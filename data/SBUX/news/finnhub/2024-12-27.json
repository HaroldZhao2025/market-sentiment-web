    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Friday largely rejected Starbucks' appeal of a National Labor Relations Board finding the coffee chain illegally fired two Philadelphia baristas because they wanted to organize a union.  The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Starbucks lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of NLRB administrative law judges, in a possible setback for companies such as Amazon.com, Trader Joe's and Elon Musk's SpaceX that have sought to limit the agency's enforcement powers.",
