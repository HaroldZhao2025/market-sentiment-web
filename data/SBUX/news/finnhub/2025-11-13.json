      "summary": "Workers United, which represents staff at about 550 of Starbucks Corp.’s roughly 10,000 company-owned US cafes, plans to strike in at least 40 cities Thursday, including locations in New York City, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and the company’s hometown of Seattle.  The protests are open-ended and could expand if there isn’t progress towards finalizing a union contract and resolving legal disputes.  The strike is pegged to Starbucks’ annual “Red Cup Day” promotion, when the company draws big crowds by giving away reusable holiday-themed cups.",
