    "summary": "Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith detail the top trending tickers on Yahoo Finance. Adani Enterprises' (ADANIENT.NS) stock fell sharply after founder Gautam Adani was charged in a $250 million bribery case. The allegations suggest the company's founder bribed Indian officials to secure green energy contracts. Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) is exploring strategic options in China, reportedly meeting with local advisers to find a potential partner that could revitalize its struggling China business segment. Volkswagen (VOW3.DE) faces potential labor unrest as union representatives seek a \"big step\" in pay negotiations. If an agreement is not reached by December, this would mark the company's first worker strike since 2018.
