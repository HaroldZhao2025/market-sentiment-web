    "summary": "A “60 Minutes” segment that was held in December by CBS News Editor in Chief  Bari Weiss  aired Sunday, the core of the piece remaining untouched but with new material bookending it.  Weiss’s decision to delay the segment on a prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, including alleged gang members, ignited a political firestorm in recent weeks that played out inside CBS News and spilled into public view.  The piece was held after Weiss raised concerns about the comment-seeking process and determined it needed additional reporting.",
