Weiss’s decision to delay the segment on a prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, including alleged gang members, ignited a political firestorm in recent weeks that played out inside CBS News and spilled into public view.  The piece was held after Weiss raised concerns about the comment-seeking process and determined it needed additional reporting.",
