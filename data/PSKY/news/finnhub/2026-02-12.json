Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), arguing that the board may need to reconsider its agreed sale to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and instead engage with Paramount Skydance's (NASDAQ:PSKY) revised proposal.  The activist, which oversees about $11 billion and disclosed a roughly $200 million stake in Warner Bros., contends that Paramount's amended terms could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal.  While that position represents less than 1% of Warner Bros.' approximately $69 billion market value as of Tuesday, the move could influence shareholders as they weigh whether to support the board-backed Netflix transaction or tender into Paramount's hostile bid.",
