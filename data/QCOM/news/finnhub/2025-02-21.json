    "headline": "Are semiconductor companies due for a shift in 2025?",
    "summary": "Semiconductor stocks are experiencing mixed reactions in 2025, especially after Chinese AI model DeepSeek rattled the market earlier this month. Citi Head of US Semiconductor Research Christopher Danely joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Alexandra Canal to explain that market movements are closely tied to the semiconductor cycle. \"First of all, we start with the cycle because the cycle determines largely the movement of semis overall, and we're still positive on the cycle,\" he said, pointing out that companies like Intel (INTC) have benefitted from short covering. Danely highlights the underperformance of companies like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), highlighting that it \"lost a major design win to Broadcom (AVGO).\" He also sees hope in analog semiconductor names like Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN). \"We could be really at the beginning of a multi-year upturn in analog [companies],\" Danely says, stressing that these stocks are positioned for growth.
