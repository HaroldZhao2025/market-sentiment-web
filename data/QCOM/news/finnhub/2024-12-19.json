An eight-person jury in a U.S. federal court in Delaware will determine whether Qualcomm or Nuvia, a startup Qualcomm purchased for $1.4 billion in 2021, breached a license agreement with U.K.-based Arm, which supplies intellectual property to both firms.  If Arm is victorious, the British firm could force Qualcomm to destroy the technology it purchased from Nuvia, which has become the basis of a chip released this year that Microsoft and the entire Windows PC industry had hoped would claw back market share lost to Apple.",
