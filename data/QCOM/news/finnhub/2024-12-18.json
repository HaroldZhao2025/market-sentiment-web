    "summary": "Internal Qualcomm documents showed the chip firm estimated it could eventually save as much as $1.4 billion a year on payments to Arm by purchasing a little-known startup in 2021, according to evidence shown at a trial on Wednesday.  The projection surfaced while Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon was testifying to a jury in Delaware federal court about his firm's rationale for purchasing Nuvia for $1.4 billion in 2021.  The chip firm's CEO was testifying as part of a trial to resolve claims that Arm can force Qualcomm to destroy the technology it acquired because Arm never consented to the transfer of Nuvia's license agreements.",
