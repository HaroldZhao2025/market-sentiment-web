    "summary": "(Reuters) -CVS Health is not entitled to coverage from insurers, including AIG and Chubb, against thousands of lawsuits over its role in the nation's opioid crisis, Delaware's highest court ruled on Monday.  The Delaware Supreme Court concluded that governments, hospitals, doctors and benefit plans that sued CVS sought damages for economic losses, not individualized \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" covered by CVS's general liability policies.  \"The national settlement agreement funds expenses in response to the opioid crisis at-large, but it does not change the fact that the underlying lawsuits do not seek specific damages tied to individualized injuries,\" Chief Justice Collins Seitz wrote for a unanimous court.",
