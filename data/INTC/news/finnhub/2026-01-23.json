    "summary": "STORY: Wall Street's main indexes ended mixed on Friday, with the Dow dropping nearly six-tenths of a percent, the S&P 500 ending basically flat and the Nasdaq gaining almost three-tenths of a percent. Friday's mixed close capped a turbulent week for stocks, with the indexes whiplashing in reaction to President Trump's see-sawing tariff threats on European allies who opposed his ambition to acquire Greenland.Stocks on Friday, however, took on a more familiar look, said Brad Conger, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan.“What we are seeing today is a very classic setup from last year, all the way from May, all the way through October - which was Mag 7 working, everything else not working. So banks, nuclear energy, meme stocks, smallcaps, they're all dramatically underperforming. And so this is in a way a flashback to sort of a pattern that we know very well, but we haven't seen it in a few months. I think this tells us something about the rotation that happened, starting around early November, that maybe it's gone far enough.”Next week may test whether many of those Magnificent Seven stocks can continue their momentum, with Apple, Tesla and Microsoft among those set to report earnings.Nvidia - which doesn't report until late February - rose on Friday after Bloomberg News reported Chinese officials have told Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance they can prepare orders for Nvidia's H200 AI chips.One tech stock that didn't perform well Friday was Intel, which nosedived 17% after the company forecast quarterly revenue and profit below market estimates, saying it struggled to satisfy demand for its server chips used in AI data centers.Investors now turn their focus to the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting beginning Tuesday, during which the central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged.",
