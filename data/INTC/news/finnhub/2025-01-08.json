    "summary": "On today's Good Buy or Goodbye, host Julie Hyman welcomes GraniteShares founder and CEO Will Rhind to discuss his view on the semiconductor sector's best and worst stock picks. Rhind recommends buying Micron Technology (MU). He notes that, despite the company's recent negative guidance and lower share price, \"this is a classic example of one of the names that has not hit the bright lights of the AI story\" but that he believes \"that's going to start to change.\" He highlights Micron's existing business relationship with Nvidia (NVDA), which could position the company nicely within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Rhind notes, \"The memory part of the AI market that they're in, the company itself expects to grow pretty dramatically in the next few years.\" He also points out that the memory chip market is \"overlooked,\" predicting a shift in Micron's favor in 2025. Conversely, Rhind suggests avoiding Intel (INTC), describing the company's declining market share as \"a slow-rolling tragedy.\" He notes that Pat Gelsinger's recent departure as CEO raises \"a lot of questions\" about Intel's direction, emphasizing the company's challenges in trying to \"prioritize for the long-term future.\" Lastly, Rhind expresses concern about Intel's dependence on government funding through the CHIPS Act, suggesting this support could shift under the incoming Trump administration.
