Tests by Microsoft, a Corintis customer, have shown the Lausanne-based startup's system, which runs liquid through tiny channels etched on the chips to draw off heat, is up to three times more efficient than standard methods.  Corintis was valued at around $400 million after the Series A funding round, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.",
