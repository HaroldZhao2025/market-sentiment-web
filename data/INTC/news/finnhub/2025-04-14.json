Monday's deal values Altera at just $8.75 billion compared to the nearly $17 billion Intel paid in 2015, but the sale will provide the company much-needed cash after hefty bets on contract manufacturing by former CEO Pat Gelsinger strained its finances.  Shedding assets, including Intel's stake in Altera, is at the center of Tan's strategy to streamline the chipmaker after predecessors failed to diversify beyond its mainstay PC and server chip business for years.",
