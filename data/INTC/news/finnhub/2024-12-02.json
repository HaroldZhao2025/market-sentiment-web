Gelsinger will be replaced on an interim basis by two senior leaders, CFO David Zinsner and CEO of Intel Products Michelle Johnston (MJ) Holthaus.  Gelsinger took the helm of Intel in 2021, tasked with reestablishing its leadership in the semiconductor industry, but the stock continued to falter under his stewardship.",
