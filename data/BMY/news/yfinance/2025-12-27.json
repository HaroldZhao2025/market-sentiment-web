    "summary": "Bristol Myers Squibb  could become the pharmaceutical industry’s turnaround story for 2026.  Shares are off 9% in 2025 after a series of drug pipeline disappointments, while major patent expirations, like one for cancer drug Revlimid, could cause earnings to fall 5% in 2026 and another 5% in 2027.  At the current price, investors are paying little for Bristol Myers’ pipeline, led by Cobenfy, a schizophrenia drug being tested as a treatment for psychosis among Alzheimer’s patients, and Milvexian, a treatment of atrial fibrillation and strokes.",
