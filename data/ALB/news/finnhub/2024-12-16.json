    "summary": "Lithium supplier Albemarle (NYSE: ALB) recently received a buy rating and a $124 price target from an Argus analyst.  The price target implies a 25% upside to the current price.  The price of lithium (a metal whose demand is largely driven by its use in electric vehicle batteries) leads Albemarle's revenue and earnings, which is why its earnings tend to be volatile and oscillate wildly from one period to the next.",
