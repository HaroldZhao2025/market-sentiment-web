    "headline": "AI infrastructure, compute: Ben Bajarin's 2025 Big Tech predictions",
    "summary": "As the AI trade welcomes a variety of new participants and infrastructure components in 2025, Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin shares several of his Big Tech predictions for this year with Asking for a Trend's Josh Lipton. Bajarin names several of the typical players in the AI semiconductor space contributing to infrastructure, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell Technology (MRVL). \"A ton of growth still going on the infrastructure side, so I imagine that that that will continue,\" Bajarin states. \"We're going to continue to see a tremendous amount of demand for compute, that's not going away. But I think what I'm looking for in 2025 is the software monetization of those stocks.\" Bajarin also weighs in on the reported boost in productivity from executives after deploying AI agents across several industries, as well as what is to be expected on cloud computing spend and Apple's (AAPL) AI-enabled computers and smart devices.

    "summary": "Nvidia (NVDA) is at the front and center of conversations concerning the AI trade as investors eye the chipmaker's early 2025 deliveries for its Blackwell GPUs (graphic processing units). \"We see significant upside once the delivery numbers ramp up. We think they're going to be able to exceed $200 billion in revenue just from this product launch for this year,\" Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska forecasts. Delevska joins Madison Mills in the Yahoo Finance studio to talk about this year's prospects for the artificial intelligence landscape, including her bull cases for semiconductor competitors Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). \"Now we are getting into a phase where we need physical build-out of data centers and power associated with them. And the US has gone through a period of time where the power infrastructure has not really been upgraded, both on the grid and the generation side,\" Delevska says about the role energy providers like Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG) will play in powering AI data center infrastructure. \"So as we've brought more renewables to market, the reliability is much lower of the grid. So what we're going to see is power prices spike up in order to incentivize new supply coming to market.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
