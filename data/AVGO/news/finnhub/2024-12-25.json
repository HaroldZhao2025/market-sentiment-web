    "summary": "Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been an outstanding investment over the past three years, as shares of the semiconductor giant have shot up an impressive 240% during this time and outpaced the 27% gains clocked by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index over the same period.  Investors may be wondering if this chipmaker has enough fuel in the tank to sustain its impressive rally for the next three years as well and if it is worth buying Broadcom stock following the solid gains it has already clocked.  In this article, we will examine Broadcom's catalysts for the next three years, check to see if this semiconductor stock is capable of delivering more upside, and analyze its valuation to find out if it is still a good bet for investors looking to add a chip stock to their portfolios.",
