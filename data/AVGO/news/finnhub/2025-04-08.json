    "summary": "Technology stocks have taken a big beating in recent months as the Trump administration's policies have led investors to press the panic button amid concerns that the tariff-fueled global trade war could hurt the U.S. economy and may even send it into a recession.  Investors have become risk-averse, which explains why high-flying tech stocks that were benefiting big time from the rapid adoption of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) have pulled back substantially.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which hit its most recent high on Dec. 16 last year, has shed nearly 23% of its value since then and now trades in bear territory.",
