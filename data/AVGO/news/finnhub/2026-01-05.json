U.S. stock indexes, where seven tech groups ​contributed half of all market earnings this year, made double-digit gains in 2025 to hit record highs as exuberance about AI and monetary easing also propelled European and ‌Asian equities to record peaks.  Expectations for further rate cuts have buoyed bonds too, handing U.S. Treasury investors the best annual performance for five years as inflation retreated, although it remains above the Federal Reserve's average 2% target.",
