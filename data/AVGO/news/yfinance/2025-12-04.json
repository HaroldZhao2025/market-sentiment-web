Such letters were sent on Tuesday to nine ETF providers, including ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares, asking ⁠them to provide ‌more clarity on the risks tied to funds that sought to track ‍up to fives times the performance of the underlying stock.  ProShares had sought approval from the Securities and Exchange ​Commission for ETFs, including products targeting to ‌replicate three times the returns of Wall Street tech giants, including Meta Platforms and Broadcom.",
