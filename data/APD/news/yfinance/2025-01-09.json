Mantle Ridge argues the industrial gases company needs to lay out a succession plan for its octogenarian CEO Seifi Ghasemi, who has served at the helm for a decade, allocate its capital differently and scale back on risky projects.  It said its four candidates, including the hedge fund's founder, Paul Hilal, would ensure greater order on the board.",
