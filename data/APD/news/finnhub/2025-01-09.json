    "summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Thursday recommended that Air Products and Chemicals investors elect all four of Mantle Ridge's board candidates, lending support to the activist investor in the year's first big board challenge.  Mantle Ridge argues the industrial gases company needs to lay out a succession plan for its octogenarian CEO Seifi Ghasemi, who has served at the helm for a decade, allocate its capital differently and scale back on risky projects.  It said its four candidates, including the hedge fund's founder, Paul Hilal, would ensure greater order on the board.",
