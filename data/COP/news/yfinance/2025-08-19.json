The jump in dealmaking marks a shift in strategy after years of focusing on shareholder returns over growth as commodity prices retreated from their 2022 high.  The sector-wide consolidation has been led by a handful of megadeals by large players, including Exxon Mobil, Diamondback Energy and ConocoPhillips.",
