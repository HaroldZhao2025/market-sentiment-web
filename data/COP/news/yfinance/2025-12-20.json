As tensions mount between Venezuela and the US, Chevron remains the only global oil company with access to the country’s immense crude reserves — the largest known.  Should US President Donald Trump, who has deployed a fleet of warships to the Venezuelan coast, attack and overthrow the government, no company would be better positioned to help rebuild the country’s battered oil industry.",
