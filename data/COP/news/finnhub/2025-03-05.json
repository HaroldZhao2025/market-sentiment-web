    "summary": "Shares of oil and gas majors ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) were all trailing the market today, falling 3.6%, 2.8%, and 4.2% at their lows, before recovering to declines of 3%, 1.9%, and 3%, respectively, as of 12:51 p.m. ET.  The declines stood in contrast to the broader market indices, which all bounced into positive territory by that time.  Unsurprisingly, oil prices were down sharply on the day.",
