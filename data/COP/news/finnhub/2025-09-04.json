On Wednesday, Reuters reported that ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance informed employees in a video message that the company will cut 20-25% of its workforce as part of a broad restructuring.  On Thursday, the company notified the Texas Workforce Commission that it anticipates the number of reductions in Houston could meet the threshold that mandates reporting to the state, ConocoPhillips spokesperson Dennis Nuss said.",
