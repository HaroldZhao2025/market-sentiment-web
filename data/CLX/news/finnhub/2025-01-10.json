    "summary": "Consumer staples behemoth Clorox (NYSE: CLX) has faced no shortage of issues over the last few years.  With ballooning inflation and a cyberattack hampering Clorox's operations (among many other companies), the company's stock still languishes 33% below its all-time highs from 2020.  This sales stability, paired with Clorox's ongoing turnaround yet depressed share price, makes it a steady-Eddie stock worth a long look today.",
