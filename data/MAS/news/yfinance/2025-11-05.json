    "summary": "Masco’s third quarter was marked by a negative market reaction following results that missed Wall Street’s revenue and earnings expectations. Management attributed the underperformance to a combination of elevated tariffs, commodity cost pressures, and ongoing industry softness, particularly in the company’s plumbing and DIY paint categories. CEO Jonathon Nudi specifically highlighted the impact of a 145% temporary tariff on China imports, which increased costs by $15 million during the quarter,",
