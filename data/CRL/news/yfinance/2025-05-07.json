Separately, the Massachusetts-based company also said that it had reached an agreement with activist investor Elliott Management.  Charles River's stock climbed to $133.36, though it has fallen approximately 37% year-to-date as the company and other contract drugmakers face sluggish demand among smaller biotech companies, negatively impacting their financial performance.",
