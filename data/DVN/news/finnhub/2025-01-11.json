The sell-off has arguably been overdone, as the price of oil spent much of last year trading with a $70 per barrel handle and trades at almost $75 per barrel at the time of this writing.  Meanwhile, Devon Energy strengthened its business through 2024, and the stock is now looking like a great value.",
