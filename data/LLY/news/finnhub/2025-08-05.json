Prices could drop further as more generic versions become available, Saynor said, noting, \"If you were selling this at $40 or $50 a month, the market could be two or three times bigger in terms of the number of patients.\"  Branded weight-loss and diabetes medications, such as Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound, are currently priced between $200 and $400 for a one-month supply, according to the FT report.",
