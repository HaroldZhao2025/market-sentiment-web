Kennedy Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has sparked concerns, particularly about his skepticism toward the pharmaceutical industry and GLP-1 drugs. Raymond James managing director and Washington Health Policy research analyst Chris Meekins joins Asking for a Trend Co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton, sharing that Kennedy's lack of executive experience raises concerns about his ability to advance policy, including securing Medicare coverage. Despite these issues, Meekins suggests that the recent sell-off in pharmaceutical and GLP-1 stocks may be an overreaction. “The sell-off we've seen might be a little bit overdone compared to what the reality could end up at the end of the day,” Meekins said.
