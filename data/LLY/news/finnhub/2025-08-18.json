Novo and rival Eli Lilly have expanded into direct-to-consumer sales for the highly effective and sought-after medicines, in part due to competition from online telehealth companies and pharmacies that sell cheaper compounded versions.  Novo already sells Wegovy, the weight-loss version of Ozempic, through its NovoCare pharmacy for $499.",

      "summary": "(Reuters) -Novo Nordisk said on Monday it was offering its diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to eligible cash-paying patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. via its own pharmacy, a tie-up with telehealth service GoodRx and other platforms.  Novo and rival Eli Lilly have expanded into direct-to-consumer sales for the highly effective and sought-after medicines, in part due to competition from online telehealth companies and pharmacies that sell cheaper compounded versions.  Novo already sells Wegovy, the weight-loss version of Ozempic, through its NovoCare pharmacy for $499.",
