The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said a federal jury reasonably found that Lilly knowingly concealed having retroactively increased prices on some drugs, and then failing to rebate Medicaid on the higher prices.  Circuit Judge Joshua Kolar said jurors heard \"ample evidence\" suggesting that Lilly \"was aware of, or disregarded, an unjustifiable risk of skirting the law and chose to obfuscate rather than conduct a reasonable inquiry.\"",
