    "summary": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -As Novo Nordisk's sales of its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy boomed, the Danish drugmaker raced to expand manufacturing capacity and sales outreach with a hiring spree that almost doubled staff numbers over five years.  Annual reports show that Novo's workforce grew from around 43,260 employees in 2019 to 77,350 by the end of last year - an average of 131 new roles filled each week, far faster than rival Eli Lilly, whose headcount rose from 36,000 to 47,000 over the same period.  Novo's rapid expansion is now under scrutiny from investors and even management, with the drugmaker facing cost pressure and heightened competition from Lilly's Zepbound and cheaper weight loss copycat compounds in the United States.",
