    "summary": "As China enters the Year of the Fire Horse—representing transformation and a time to break old habits—some economists expect Beijing to lower its official economic growth target and further shift its focus to reviving consumer confidence and spending.  The sentiment going into this week’s Lunar New Year is sharply different than the pessimism of a year ago, as China stacked up some wins in 2025: reigniting enthusiasm in its stock market with start-up DeepSeek’s artificial-intelligence successes and leveraging its critical-minerals dominance to reach a detente with the U.S. These feats help lay the groundwork for its transition into a more self-reliant economy and efforts to rebuild consumer confidence.",
