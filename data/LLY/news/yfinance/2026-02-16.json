If you aren’t paying attention to the companies behind a new wave of AI-driven drug development, you may end up missing out on essential investment opportunities. One company that has caught our attention is Chai Discovery, founded in 2024 by co-founder Joshua Meier. After graduating from Harvard, Meier began working as a researcher at OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) during the development of GPT-1 and GPT-2. He then worked at Meta's generative biology group, where he co-led the development of ESM1, the first transformer protein-language model. Chai Discovery is currently one of the buzziest startups in AI drug development. In December, the company completed a Series B funding round, raising an additional $130 million at a valuation of $1.3 billion, cementing its unicorn status. Backers include Silicon Valley heavyweights such as General Catalyst and OpenAI. The company also recently inked a deal with Eli Lilly (LLY), under which the drug giant will use Chai’s models.
