As for Expedia, he described it as \"a self-help turnaround story,\" noting the company's success in overcoming minor disruptions to regain market share. \"Travel trends are positive. People have jobs, people are spending money, and people are getting on airplanes,\" Bellisario told Yahoo Finance, emphasizing the sector's strong fundamentals. However, he also identified key risks facing these companies.
