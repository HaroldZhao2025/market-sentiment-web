    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration reversed course and agreed to begin a review of  Moderna’s  application to sell a new seasonal flu shot after the vaccine maker agreed to conduct additional testing in the elderly.  The move means that Moderna’s experimental flu shot is largely back on track after the FDA’s surprise decision earlier this month to refuse to start a review of its application.  Moderna said it also met with the FDA and proposed a revised approach.",
