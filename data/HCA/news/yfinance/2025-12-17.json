    "summary": "Oscar Health rallied on Wednesday morning amid an intraparty GOP rebellion over ACA subsidies, though other S&P 500 health care stocks lost more ground.  Centene, the top ACA Marketplace insurer by membership, and HCA Healthcare, the largest U.S. hospital operator, fell for a third straight session, with much of the damage coming Tuesday as House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled he wouldn't allow a vote on a bipartisan compromise plan to extend the subsidies.  On Monday, Morgan Stanley downgraded HCA to underweight from equal weight on Monday, saying its high valuation is at a peak as Washington reins in growth of the ACA Marketplaces and Medicaid supplemental payments.",
