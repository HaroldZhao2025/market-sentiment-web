    "summary": "Chipmaker Intel, has tested chipmaking tools this year from a toolmaker with deep roots in China and two overseas units that were targeted by U.S. sanctions, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.  Intel, which fended off calls for its CEO’s resignation from President Donald Trump in August over his alleged ties to China, got the tools from ACM Research, a Fremont, California-based producer of chipmaking ​equipment.  Two of ACM's units, based in Shanghai and South Korea, were among a number of firms barred last year from receiving U.S. technology over claims they have supported the Chinese government’s efforts at harnessing commercial technology for military use and making advanced chips ‌or chipmaking tools.",
