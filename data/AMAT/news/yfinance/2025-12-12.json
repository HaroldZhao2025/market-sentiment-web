Intel, which fended off calls for its CEO’s resignation from President Donald Trump in August over his alleged ties to China, got the tools from ACM Research, a Fremont, California-based producer of chipmaking ​equipment.  Two of ACM's units, based in Shanghai and South Korea, were among a number of firms barred last year from receiving U.S. technology over claims they have supported the Chinese government’s efforts at harnessing commercial technology for military use and making advanced chips ‌or chipmaking tools.",
