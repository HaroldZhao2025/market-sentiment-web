    "headline": "White House Touts $270 Billion Worth of Deals at Saudi-palooza",
    "summary": "A day after the White House proclaimed that Saudi Arabia boosted its spring pledge to invest $600 billion in the US to a tidy $1 trillion during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to Washington, DC, President Donald Trump said companies from both nations inked $270 billion in deals at a US-Saudi business forum.  No timeline was given for Saudi Arabia’s $1 trillion in investments and, while the US-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday drew corporate royalty from Chevron, Tesla, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Cisco, General Dynamics, Pfizer and more, it wasn’t immediately clear which companies inked deals.  Trump did say GE Aerospace will “deliver dozens of new engines” while a handful of other pacts, while short on financial details, highlighted some international bargaining.",
