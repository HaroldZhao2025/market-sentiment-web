Jane Hali & Associates senior research analyst Jessica Ramirez sits down with Madison Mills and Brad Smith to speak more about consumer trends heading into Black Friday and Christmas sales promotions. \"[The] low-income consumer and middle-income consumer continue to be pressured as we go into the holiday season. They have been spacing out the way that they buy in order to make sure that they have their gifts for the holiday season,\" Ramirez explains. \"And because we've had the pressure from inflation throughout the year and... from late last year, it has started to really take on savings of consumers. So it's still very tough.\" She elaborates that retailer promotions have also been \"very strategic\" in comparison to inventory levels.
