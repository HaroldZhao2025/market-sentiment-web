    "summary": "Eli Lilly & Co, Cardinal Health Inc. and Biogen Inc. are among the top 10 performers in the S&P 500 since Oct. 28, the last time the index closed at a record.  In contrast, the S&P 500 Information Technology index is down 4.2% since then, with bigger losses coming from Magnificent Seven stocks like Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp.  The moves suggest that investor are still skittish about the artificial intelligence trade as concerns linger about valuations and whether all the heavy spending on computing power will pay off with profits.",
