The U.S. Treasury Department late last month authorized Chevron to operate in the sanctioned OPEC nation again, export its oil and do swaps with PDVSA through a restricted license banning any payments to Venezuela's government.  Chevron suspended loading of Venezuelan crude in April ahead of its prior license's expiration on May 27.",
