Since 2019, Venezuela's oil industry has been under U.S. sanctions designed to curb its oil income and force out President Nicolas Maduro in response to electoral fraud following his re-election in 2018 and a disputed election in 2024.  Chevron has been allowed since 2022 to export oil to recoup unpaid dividends from joint venture partners.",
