    "summary": "HOUSTON (Reuters) -ConocoPhillips must sharpen its focus on capital discipline and investment priorities in order to regain its competitiveness against peers as oil prices and revenues fall, investors and analysts said, after the company announced last week it would lay off up to 25% of staff to cut costs.  The third-largest U.S. oil producer joins majors Chevron and BP, and the world's largest oil service providers SLB and Halliburton, in cutting staff as increased output from OPEC+ and economic uncertainty due to unpredictable U.S. trade policy have contributed to a slump in crude prices, pushing down oil company earnings to their lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic.  Crude prices, which have fallen around 12% this year, are expected to decline again in 2026 as supply outpaces demand, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies in the OPEC+ producer group are increasing output to win back market share that was lost to the United States and other producers in recent years.
