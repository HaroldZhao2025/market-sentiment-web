TGNR is already the fourth biggest producer in the Haynesville shale basin and the deal would allow it to reap synergies of over $170 million during the asset's development, Craig Jarchow, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.  Haynesville's location in east Texas and northwest Louisiana is ideal for exports from liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and projects clustered on the nearby Gulf Coast, and has investors' attention as U.S. President Donald Trump aims to boost gas exports.",
