      "summary": "HOUSTON (Reuters) -Chevron beat analyst estimates for second-quarter profit on Friday as record oil and gas production and lower capital expenditure helped to offset the impact of lower crude prices.  The No. 2 U.S. oil major last month headed off a legal challenge from the biggest U.S. producer Exxon Mobil enabling it to close its $55 billion acquisition of Hess.  The deal includes a stake in the Stabroek Block oilfield, offshore Guyana, that Exxon operates, and should provide Chevron with a source of long-term growth to help to fund dividends into the 2030s and make Chevron's earnings more resilient to oil price volatility.",
