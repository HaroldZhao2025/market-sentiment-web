    "summary": "The Trump administration issued a general license expanding the ability of oil companies to operate in Venezuela, marking a significant step to ease sanctions under the new US-backed leadership in Caracas.  The license issued by the US Treasury Department Thursday covers a variety of activities that could expedite the movement of Venezuelan crude, including exporting, selling, storing and refining that oil, as long as the work is performed by a US entity.  According to an administration official, it does not cover upstream crude production inside the country where currently just one US oil company — Chevron Corp. — operates under a special US license.",
