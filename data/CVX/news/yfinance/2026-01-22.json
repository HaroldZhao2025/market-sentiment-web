When Venezuela’s national oil company contracted a resource certification consultancy to evaluate the vast Orinoco Oil Belt in the late-2000s, experts say the Chávez government seized on — and embellished — the results to project political influence at home and abroad at a time of spiraling oil prices and resource nationalist fervor.  “Some of the numbers that were accredited to our firm were not necessarily exactly what we were calculating,” said Herman Acuña, president of Houston-based Ryder Scott that assessed the full belt in stages from 2008 to 2011, using logs from Petróleos de Venezuela SA. Ryder Scott issued public clarifications at the time to highlight the contingent nature of the resources, he said.",
