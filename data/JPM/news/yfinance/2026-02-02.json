Tang said that Kevin Warsh's nomination as Federal Reserve chair doesn't alter a broadly supportive policy backdrop for gold, while the longer-term erosion of global fiscal discipline is also unlikely to reverse.  J.P. Morgan Private Bank raises its year-end gold target to $6,150 a troy ounce, with a forecast range of $6,000 to $6,300, noting that investor positioning remains far from crowded.",
