    "summary": "Venezuela could raise production to 2.5 million barrels per day over the next decade, up from the current level of 0.8 million, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. In the short term, it’s unclear how much oil Venezuela will be able to export due to the political transition and whether flows to China will continue.  And while President Donald Trump has said US companies will spend billions of dollars to rebuild the country’s energy infrastructure over the longer term, there are big doubts about whether the oil majors will want to invest in what is a very uncertain environment.",
