JPMorgan Chase  CEO Jamie Dimon, the personification of Wall Street’s early warning system, told an investor event in New York on Monday that “there’s always a surprise in a credit cycle” that can escalate into a larger financial crisis.  The $3 trillion private-credit market is the latest corner of the global financial system to be caught up in the downdraft of selling tied to the artificial-intelligence investment trade.",

        "summary": "The problem with trying to heed a warning from the nation’s most important banker, who is worried about rivals doing “dumb stuff” reminiscent of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, is that the stuff in question is really hard to see.  JPMorgan Chase  CEO Jamie Dimon, the personification of Wall Street’s early warning system, told an investor event in New York on Monday that “there’s always a surprise in a credit cycle” that can escalate into a larger financial crisis.  The $3 trillion private-credit market is the latest corner of the global financial system to be caught up in the downdraft of selling tied to the artificial-intelligence investment trade.",
