On top of this, with trillions of dollars being deployed into AI, it is likely that new AI applications will propel mobile data consumption even higher and require greater bandwidth, lower latency, and more uplink capacity than today's typical usage.  As carriers invest in this capacity, we expect our U.S. portfolio to deliver durable, long-term, mid-single-digit organic growth.",
